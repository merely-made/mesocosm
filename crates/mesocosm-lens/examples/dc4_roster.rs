//! DC4's receipt: the eight authored bodies, at the framing the game uses.
//!
//! Every earlier archetype capture was a three-quarter beauty shot. This one
//! traces each body through the **ruled section framing** — an orthographic
//! slab of half-height 28 looking along `-z`, which is what
//! `mesocosm-genet`'s terrarium view is — over the same grown Ground a world
//! founds on. If a body does not read as a critter here it does not read as one
//! in the game.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p mesocosm-lens --release --example dc4_roster -- <out_dir>
//! ```
//!
//! **Two cuts.** The shipping section looks along `-z`, and `develop_body`
//! chains a body's segments along `+z` — so the terrarium view looks straight
//! down every body's own axis and a thirty-part animal draws as a blob with two
//! side stubs. That is a finding rather than a framing mistake, so each
//! archetype is captured both ways: `dc4_<name>.png` broadside (the slab turned
//! a quarter, which is the only cut that shows a body plan) and
//! `dc4_<name>_axial.png` down the axis, as the game draws it today.
//!
//! Also writes `dc4_roster.png`, a two-row contact sheet of the broadside cuts.
