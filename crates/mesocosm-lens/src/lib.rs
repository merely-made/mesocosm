///
/// **The arithmetic.** The tracer is fragment-only for downlevel reach —
/// WebGL2 has neither compute nor storage buffers — so the roster has to be a
/// uniform, and the binding it has to fit is the *downlevel* one:
/// `Limits::downlevel_webgl2_defaults().max_uniform_buffer_binding_size` is
/// **16 384 bytes**, a quarter of the 65 536 desktop default. `g2_glprobe`
/// requests exactly those limits, so this is a live ceiling, not a hypothesis.
///
/// A pose costs `bounds 16 + tint_count 16 + 32 · capsules` bytes:
///
/// - at [`MAX_CAPSULES`] a pose is 8 256 B (eyes included), so a
///   full-fidelity roster would admit `(16384 − 16) / 8256 = 1` member. One is
///   not an ecology.
/// - roster members are background silhouettes rather than the played body,
///   so they drop the eyes and carry [`MAX_ROSTER_CAPSULES`]: 384 B each.
/// - the binding is then `16 + 40 · 384 = 15 376` B, 93.8% of the downlevel
///   limit (23.5% of the desktop one). That is all 40 members can be given:
///   the budget is `M × (C + 1) ≤ 511` and `40 × 12 = 480`.
///
/// Why 40 and 11 rather than some other split of the same bytes: a genesis
/// enclosure of 60 organisms puts 26–34 of them inside the section's slab
/// (measured across seeds), and a developed body carries a median of 8–19
/// living parts. So the member cap clears observed occupancy with margin, and
/// the capsule budget covers a median body. A slab that ever holds more than
/// 40 truncates, and says so through `BrickDiagnostics::roster_dropped`.
///
/// The played critter is not a roster member. It keeps the single pose and
/// its full [`MAX_CAPSULES`], which is why the split exists at all.
