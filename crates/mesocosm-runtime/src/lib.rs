//! Mesocosm's host-neutral runtime.
//!
//! Sits between [`mesocosm_core`] and any host. A host owns the window, the
//! device, and the frame loop; it hands elapsed time in, queues intents, and
//! reads the world back to draw it.
//!
//! # Why this is shared rather than per-host
//!
//! The host probe compares a custom Genet lane against an engine lane. If each
//! host wrote its own stepping, a difference between them could be a
//! difference in *stepping* rather than in the host, and the comparison would
//! measure the wrong thing. Both hosts drive the world through this crate, so
//! a divergence is attributable.
//!
//! This is also the extraction candidate named in the body pipeline plan: if
//! Paredros ever wants it, it gets renamed and lifted with two real consumers
//! justifying the move. Until then it stays here and stays small.
//!
//! # Frame delivery does not reach the simulation
//!
//! [`Clock`] converts elapsed microseconds into whole fixed steps and keeps
//! the remainder. The number of steps for a given total elapsed time is fixed,
//! however raggedly that time arrives, and a step cap defers work rather than
//! dropping it. Time is integer microseconds for the same reason the core is
//! integer-only.
