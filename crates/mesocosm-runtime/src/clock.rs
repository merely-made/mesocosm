//! The fixed-step clock.
//!
//! A host measures elapsed wall time however it likes and hands it here. The
//! clock converts it into a whole number of simulation steps and keeps the
//! remainder, so the number of steps taken depends only on total elapsed time
//! and never on how that time arrived.
//!
//! Time is integer microseconds. The core is integer-only for determinism, and
//! a float accumulator here would put the host platform's rounding behaviour
//! back into the step count.
//!
//! The accumulator is kept in *rational* form: elapsed microseconds are scaled
//! by the tick rate and compared against one second, rather than divided by a
//! precomputed interval. A precomputed interval would have to round (60 Hz is
//! 16666.67 microseconds, and 1_000_000 is not divisible by 60), and the
//! rounding error would accumulate as drift. This way every tick rate is
//! exact and no rate is refused.
