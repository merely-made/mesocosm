//! The bounded ecology reducer.
//!
//! The driver already drains a tick of causal events and rebuilds them on
//! replay, so it is where a replay-derived reduction of the flow stream belongs
//! (PE0, playable ecology plan §8). Nothing here is authority: it reads two
//! streams the world emitted and keeps fixed-size integer windows over them.
//!
//! # Bounded, and explicitly so
//!
//! One ring of [`RETENTION_TICKS`] per-tick totals. Two windows are read off it
//! — the whole ring for replacement, [`JUDGEMENT_TICKS`] for support — because
//! several resolutions may coexist but every retention length has to be stated
//! and tested. Nothing here grows with the length of a run.
//!
//! # Deterministic
//!
//! Integers only, summed over a fixed slice in a fixed order, from streams that
//! are themselves a function of the seed and the trace. So a replay reduces to
//! the same windows byte for byte, which `tests/readings.rs` asserts by encoding
//! both and comparing the bytes.
