//! The lineage checkpoint's reading: what the epoch came to, and what the
//! played line could do about it. (PE3b)
//!
//! # Why it is here and not in the world
//!
//! Three of the four halves a review is made of live beside a world rather than
//! inside one. The **reckoning** is [`World::reckon`]'s, which takes the past;
//! the **trend** is [`crate::readings::FlowWindows`]', which is a bounded
//! reduction the snapshot deliberately excludes; and the **second proposal
//! source** reads a pack off a disk, which a deterministic integer-only core
//! must not do. The fourth half — the candidates, their scores, their prices
//! and their previews — *is* the world's, and it stays there as
//! [`World::offers`]. This assembles them and adds nothing of its own.
//!
//! It is built when the checkpoint opens and again after a commit, never per
//! frame: each row costs a bounded scoring run, which is the same price an
//! unplayed line's turn pays and not one a redraw should.
//!
//! # Two proposal sources over one authority
//!
//! A candidate has a proposal the game builds — `Candidate::propose`, the first
//! part of the right shape and tissue off the top of its lattice — and, where a
//! pack declares an expression script for that candidate's process, a second
//! one the author wrote. Both are *proposals*; the one validator still decides,
//! and neither is shown as a decision. The row says which is which by name,
//! and a script that refuses says so in its own words.
//!
//! Entropy for the authored call is the host's and comes from
//! [`World::draw`] — this world's own seeded stream, read without moving it —
//! so a review built twice makes the same call twice. A fresh
//! [`Runner`](mesocosm_phenotype::express::Runner) is loaded per call for the
//! same reason: script determinism is per runner, so a runner reused across
//! calls could answer differently the second time.
