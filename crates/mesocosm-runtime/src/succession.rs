//! The individual checkpoint: the game stops and asks one question.
//!
//! Reproduction is the checkpoint at the scale of one critter (playable ecology
//! plan §1). Descent becomes concrete, a parent pays for an offspring, and the
//! player may continue through a descendant. **It is not the epoch**, and it
//! must not silently invoke one: there is no program revision here, no lineage
//! budget, no founder preview, and nothing a player can edit. One question, two
//! answers, play resumes.
//!
//! # It lives in the driver, and that is the whole design
//!
//! PE0's seam finding is that the missing checkpoint is *host, control and
//! presentation composition rather than a second breeding system*. So nothing
//! below is a world rule. The breeding transaction is untouched: the adult-mass
//! gate, filial realization, the matter debit, the parent link and
//! `Event::Born` are exactly what they were, and this reads their records.
//!
//! The consequence is worth stating plainly. A pause is a question about **when
//! to step**, which is the driver's own job — it already owns the clock, the
//! step cap and the queue. So `World` gained one intent ([`Intent::Resume`]) and
//! nothing else: no checkpoint field, no held flag, no new snapshot byte. A
//! replay therefore lands on the byte-identical state hash it always did, and
//! the enclosure driven straight through `World::apply` — the population
//! instrument, every headless lab — cannot even observe that this module exists.
//!
//! # What opens one
//!
//! Three occasions, and all of them require a **hand on the critter**.
//! [`World::held`] is the ruled distinction between *control* (whose body a key
//! would move) and *holding* (whether anybody has moved it lately, TD4). An ant
//! farm nobody is touching is the feature; stopping it to ask an empty chair a
//! question would be the opposite. So an idle terrarium runs on, and every
//! existing headless fixture keeps its exact timing.
//!
//! # The third occasion is the lineage's, not an individual's (PE3a)
//!
//! [`Occasion::Epoch`] is the other checkpoint the epoch-boundary plan §0
//! separates from this one: the epoch's budget is spent, every unplayed line
//! has taken its turn, and the played line has not. **The world ends its own
//! epoch** — the Timed rule is a versioned world rule, so a headless enclosure
//! obeys it too — and what lives here is only the *hold*, exactly as it is for
//! a birth: stepping is the driver's job, so not stepping is too.
//!
//! It is still not the trait board. There is no review here, no founder
//! preview and no budget; PE3b owns those. What this adds is the one place a
//! revision is admitted at all.
//!
//! # What answers one
//!
//! [`Intent::TakeControl`] or [`Intent::Resume`] — take, or carry on. Both are
//! ordinary recorded intents, so the choice is in the trace and replays with
//! everything else, and eligibility stays where it was rather than growing a
//! second gate here. At the lineage checkpoint [`Intent::Revise`] is an answer
//! too, and the one answer that does **not** close the question: a revision is
//! taken *at* the checkpoint, and the world stays there until it is resumed.
//!
