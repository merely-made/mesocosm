//! **The lineage checkpoint, driven.** PE3b's runtime half: the played line's
//! turn arrives with the boundary, carries the reckoning and the trend beside
//! the table, and goes away again when the world resumes.
//!
//! The second proposal source lives here too, because it is the one half of a
//! review that reads a disk: a pack declares an expression script, the review
//! runs it through the bounded runner with the host's own entropy, and the row
//! carries both proposals marked by name.
