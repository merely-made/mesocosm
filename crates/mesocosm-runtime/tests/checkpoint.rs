//! **The individual checkpoint, driven.** PE1's runtime half: a birth involving
//! the critter under your hand stops the world, one recorded choice resumes it,
//! and a body ending offers the line rather than the wall.
//!
//! Every birth below is the ordinary breeding transaction. Nothing here forces
//! one: the run takes control of a founder the adult-mass gate has already
//! cleared, and the next tick does what it was going to do anyway.
//!
//! The load-bearing negative is the first test. An enclosure nobody is touching
//! must never be interrupted — that is TD4's ruling and it is also why every
//! headless fixture in the workspace, the population instrument included, keeps
//! its exact timing across this phase.
