//! The interchange artifact: a body, flattened, with its history attached.
//!
//! Wave 1.4 ruled that games couple **by data, not by types** — Mesocosm
//! writes, Isometry reads with its own small adapter, and neither repo depends
//! on the other. This module is Mesocosm's half of that seam: the bytes that
//! ride as a part of a `mere.pack/v1` bundle.
//!
//! Nothing here depends on mere or on eidetic. A pack carries an inventory of
//! content-addressed blobs; what is *inside* a blob is the writing game's
//! business, and this is that inside. Depending on the platform to define a
//! game's own artifact would invert the wing's rule that the federation layer
//! is extracted from shipped games rather than built before them.
//!
//! # V0 crosses a projection, not the body document
//!
//! The first cut of this module put a whole [`BodyDocument`] on the wire, and
//! that quietly broke the ruling it was built to satisfy. A reader would have
//! needed `mesocosm-core` to decode it — attachment graph, pivots, body plan
//! and all — which is a type dependency wearing a data dependency's clothes.
//! "Isometry reads it with its own small adapter" is only true if the adapter
//! is small.
//!
//! So every field here is a primitive, a fixed-size array, or a `Vec` of
//! those. A reader mirrors [`BodyProfile`] in about twenty lines of plain
//! structs, decodes with any postcard, and never links a line of this game.
//!
//! V0 proves that appearance and provenance can cross through primitive local
//! mirror types. It does not settle the permanent anatomy contract. The wing's
//! later ruling makes primitive part identity and parent links portable at v1,
//! while exact geometry remains an optional projection and each vessel derives
//! its own capabilities. The live body document remains Mesocosm's authority.
//!
//! # Why the header is raw bytes
//!
//! The plan booked the cost of this seam honestly: drift between writer and
//! reader becomes a runtime failure rather than a build failure, so the
//! profile needs a version field and a refusal path from the first commit.
//!
//! A version field *inside* the serialized struct does not deliver that.
//! Postcard is not self-describing — it is a positional encoding with no field
//! tags — so when the payload layout changes, the decoder cannot reach the
//! version field to discover that it should have refused. It fails as a
//! malformed decode, or worse, succeeds and returns nonsense.
//!
//! So the schema tag and version sit in a **fixed-position header ahead of the
//! payload**, in a form that never changes: an 8-byte magic and a
//! little-endian `u16`. Those can be checked without decoding anything, which
//! is what makes [`ProfileError::UnknownVersion`] a real diagnosis instead of
//! a guess. The payload's shape is free to change underneath.
//!
//! # Why attribution is a second grid
//!
//! [`flatten`](crate::flatten) composes every part into one occupancy grid,
//! and in doing so it discards which part wrote each cell — the grid records
//! materials, not history. That is right for the mesher and wrong for this
//! seam, because the body's whole legibility rule is that **the world is
//! colour-coded by role and the player is colour-coded by history**. A sprite
//! baked from materials alone cannot show where a limb was taken from.
//!
//! So the profile carries a parallel [`attribution`](BodyProfile::attribution)
//! grid: same dimensions, each cell naming the part that wrote it. Provenance
//! is then recoverable per voxel, and a reader that does not care can ignore
//! it entirely.
