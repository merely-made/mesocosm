//! The minimap adapter: who holds where, disclosed as a score.
//!
//! # The cells are simulation truth
//!
//! `Places::at` assigns a position to its nearest site; `Arrangement::Hulls`
//! partitions by the same rule. So the cells a solved minimap scene draws are
//! **exactly** the regions the world itself reasons with, not a cartographer's
//! approximation of them. A congruence test holds the two rules together.
//!
//! # Dominance is derived, never stored
//!
//! Which lineage holds a region is read off the living roster at projection
//! time, the same discipline as capability, temperament, and the possibility
//! space: a stored verdict drifts from the facts it was drawn from, and a
//! derived one cannot.
