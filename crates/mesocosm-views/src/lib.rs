//! Mesocosm's view layer, adapter-first.
//!
//! The stack's projection posture, adopted from birth rather than migrated to:
//! this crate **discloses** world facts as a [`sceno::Score`], `scenomise`
//! solves placement, and the paint leaves here realize the solved scene. The
//! layout debt isometry carried (hand-rolled positions the proofs plan
//! schedules for deletion) is never incurred.
//!
//! What a scene element *means* stays on this side of the contract, per the
//! per-vessel ruling: sceno carries geometry and source references; this crate
//! decides that a region's tint is the lineage that dominates it.

//! The second lane, added 2026-08-29: the cambium chrome that says things.
//! [`vitals`] is Mesocosm's first consumer of it. Same posture as the paint
//! leaves — the view fn and its sheet live here, host-agnostic, and the host
//! decides only where the result lands.
