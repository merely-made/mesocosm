//! The dev lane's surface: what the host is doing to time, and what the critter
//! under the camera is. (DT1, DT2)
//!
//! Same posture as [`crate::vitals`] and [`crate::succession`]: a **reading**,
//! taken fresh from facts the host already holds. Nothing here is stored in the
//! world, enters the trace, or reaches the state hash — the dev tools plan's
//! second principle is what makes that true by construction. Pause, step, speed
//! and *follow* are host state over `mesocosm_runtime::Runtime`, never a second
//! authority over the world, so this panel has nothing to say that a replay
//! could ever disagree with.
//!
//! DT1's four facts are the top section. DT2's inspector is the second one, and
//! every line of it is a core query put into words — see [`follow`], where that
//! discipline is spelled out and the two readings DT2 had to add to core are
//! named.
