//! The in-epoch vitals surface: what the played critter has, and what the
//! world just said back — a refusal, or what the body did with a meal.
//!
//! The cambium lane (ruled 2026-08-29), and Mesocosm's first consumer of it.
//! Words and numbers are expected here; the painted lane keeps its own
//! discipline and grows no lettering. The first real playtest ran with energy,
//! refusals and death all unsurfaced, which is what this exists against.
//!
//! Host-agnostic, like the paint leaves beside it: this crate says what the
//! panel *is*, and the host says where its raster lands.
