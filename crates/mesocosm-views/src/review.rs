//! The trait board: the played line's own turn, on screen. (PE3b)
//!
//! The fourth cambium surface, and the second that appears because the world is
//! **waiting**. Where `succession` asks one question about one critter, this
//! asks the lineage's: the epoch is reckoned, every other line has already
//! weighed what it could, and yours has not.
//!
//! **It is a table, not an editor.** Nothing here arranges tissue, names a
//! cell, or prices anything: every number on it was read off the world by
//! `World::offers` and the driver's review, and the only things a player can do
//! are move the selection, commit the selected candidate, and leave. The
//! candidate's own proposals are *shown* — the game's, and a pack's where one
//! applies — because two proposal sources over one validator is a fact worth
//! being able to see, not because a player picks between them.
//!
//! Host-agnostic like the panels beside it: this crate says what the surface is
//! and what its words are, the host says where the raster lands, and the driver
//! decides when there is anything to show.
