//! The attribution probe: one run, one target per ruling.
//!
//! Written for TD8's three rulings and extended in TD9 for its two, because a
//! second probe measuring the same world from the same events would only be a
//! second thing to keep in step. The file keeps its TD8 name; the receipt is
//! per round, so `td8_attribution.json` stays as TD8 recorded it and this
//! writes `td9_attribution.json`.
//!
//! The population instrument reads a *verdict*; this reads whether each ruling
//! moved the thing it was aimed at. A round that only moves the total has not
//! shown its rulings did anything, so each gets its own numbers:
//!
//! 1. **Reproduction gates on adult mass** was aimed at **recruitment** —
//!    consumers and decomposers reaching a breeding size. Reported as births
//!    and deaths per kingdom, and the mean of `biomass_mg / mass_ceiling_mg`
//!    over the living, which is TD7's finding table re-measured.
//! 2. **Corpses persist longer** was aimed at **decomposer persistence** —
//!    carrion as a standing resource rather than an event. Reported as the mean
//!    standing carrion count, total scavenged milligrams, decomposers alive at
//!    the horizon, and how long a dying decomposer had gone unfed.
//! 3. **No actuator, no travel** was aimed at the **free-lunch species** — a
//!    body with no `Limb` tagma that grazed at a plant's price. Reported as the
//!    founding count of unlimbed consumers and decomposers, the `Moved` events
//!    they emitted, what they ate, and whether they were still standing at the
//!    horizon.
//! 4. **The bite scales with build** (TD9) was aimed at the **specific gap TD8
//!    measured**: consumers clearing TD2c's ~75% prey hit-rate bar and starving
//!    anyway on 5-11 mg mouthfuls. Reported by the numbers that named it — hit
//!    rate, mouthful, the starvation-against-age death split — plus the
//!    consumer biomass trajectory, so a kingdom that is merely dying more
//!    slowly can be told from one that is holding.
//! 5. **Producers creep** (TD9) was aimed at **spread without the free lunch**.
//!    Reported as producer `Moved` events and the count of distinct occupancy
//!    cells each kingdom stands in, against the unlimbed consumers and
//!    decomposers of target 3, who must stay at zero movements.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p mesocosm-core --example td8_attribution --release
//! ```
//!
//! Writes `Code/testing/mesocosm/td9_attribution.json` and prints the same
//! numbers. Seeds and horizon are arguments so a before/after pair is one
//! command each; the defaults are TD7's own probe window (3,000 ticks) over the
//! seeds its finding table quoted plus seed 2, whose consumer species is the
//! free-lunch draw the third ruling names.
