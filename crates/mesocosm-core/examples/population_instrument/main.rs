//! TD1's headless population instrument, carried through TD2, TD2b, TD2c,
//! TD2d, TD5, TD5b, TD6, TD7, S1, TD8 and TD9 as each round's measuring stick.
//!
//! Founds real worlds and drives them with nothing but `Intent::Idle` for
//! several starter lifespans, sampling per-kingdom alive counts, total
//! biomass, and cumulative births/deaths every `SAMPLE_INTERVAL` ticks. A
//! verdict is read off the curve by simple, stated arithmetic: no fitted
//! models, no significance tests. See `design_docs/2026-08-29_terrarium_dynamics_plan.md`, TD1.
//!
//! Four batches run: a **baseline** whose every tier still draws
//! (`Founding::Drawn`, DC1.5's founding), an **archetype arm** founding the
//! consumer tier alone from the browsing hexapod (`Founding::BrowsingConsumer`,
//! DC2), the **roster** founding all eight archetypes (`Founding::Roster`,
//! DC4 — and what ships), and a **control** founded with a single organism and
//! no producer to feed it (expected to collapse). The control is what proves
//! the verdict logic can say something other than the baseline's answer — an
//! instrument that only ever reads one way has not shown anything.
//!
//! **Split at the 600-line ceiling** into `measure` (a run and its verdict) and
//! `receipt` (the JSON) when DC4 added the third batch.
//!
//! A count inside its band is not enough to pass. [`Verdict::Thins`] catches
//! the world that holds its numbers by becoming a producer stand; TD2b's
//! receipt called six such runs "breathes" before this verdict existed.
//!
//! Boil and collapse both exit a run early once decided (see [`run`]) — a
//! fixed 10,000-tick horizon is not practical to *run* to the end on a
//! chain that is actively boiling, since its own per-tick cost grows with
//! it. Only a run that never tips either way pays for the full horizon.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p mesocosm-core --example population_instrument --release
//! ```
//!
//! Writes `Code/testing/mesocosm/dc4_roster.json` (curves + verdicts
//! per seed) and prints a terminal summary; each earlier round's receipt
//! keeps its own filename and none is overwritten. `Code/testing/<repo>/` is this
//! workspace's standing receipts convention; the path is found by walking up
//! from this crate to the `repos` ancestor rather than a fixed `../` count,
//! so it survives the crate moving depth within the repo.
