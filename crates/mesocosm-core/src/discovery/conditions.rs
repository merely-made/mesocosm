//! The conditions this world admits, and the numbers they are made of.
//!
//! Split out of `discovery.rs` at the 600-line ceiling. What stayed next door
//! is the evidence, the rules and the routing; what moved here is the **table**
//! — the fixed, small set of conditions a piece of evidence is offered to, and
//! the thresholds they read.
//!
//! # A digest, not a name
//!
//! [`ConditionId`] is a hash over a condition's rule-bearing bytes, exactly as
//! [`ProcessRef`](crate::process::ProcessRef) is over a definition's. The
//! friendly name is presentation. Two worlds that agree about a name and
//! disagree about the rule under it hold different digests, so a discovery made
//! in one cannot be resolved against the other — which is the same protection
//! PD1b gave allocation, applied to acquisition.
//!
//! # Where the numbers come from
//!
//! None of the four is picked. The stress horizon is the starved line itself,
//! the evidence floor is the ecology's own answer to "how much substance is a
//! body at all", and the two cell counts are the ones PD2's fixtures already
//! use for the same organ.
