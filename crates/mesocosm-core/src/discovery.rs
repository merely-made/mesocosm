//! How a line comes to a new developmental option. (PE2)
//!
//! # Unlocks are evidence, not a diet tree
//!
//! Eating may supply material, a donor, and an observation. It does **not** map
//! a food category to a matching reward category (playable ecology plan §1). So
//! the thing that unlocks is a [`Condition`]: a small declared program over
//! accepted [`Evidence`], which may cite a donor part, survival through a
//! quantified stress, or — later — repeated use, exposure, a relationship or a
//! lineage achievement. `World::learn_from` taught every non-innate appendage in
//! the *donor's whole recipe* on every meal; it was named a migration input and
//! this is what replaced it.
//!
//! # The execution boundary, made structural
//!
//! The traits brief's 2026-09-01 boundary asks for four things and each is a
//! property of the types here rather than a discipline somebody has to keep:
//!
//! - **Event-driven.** [`evaluate`] runs once per accepted piece of evidence.
//!   Nothing polls organisms, and no condition runs on an ecology tick.
//! - **Declared inputs.** A [`Condition`] names the [`Input`] lanes it will
//!   accept, and evidence of any other kind cannot reach it — it is recorded
//!   as [`Miss::UndeclaredInput`] instead. A meal therefore cannot satisfy an
//!   endurance condition however hungry the eater was.
//! - **Bounded.** The condition table is fixed and small, a rule is a compare
//!   against one integer, and the only accumulator a rule reads is an
//!   authoritative one the world keeps (`World::hunger_run`) — never a
//!   view-only trend.
//! - **Recorded.** A [`Discovery`] carries the matched evidence, the route it
//!   arrived through, the **realized candidate reference** (an exact
//!   [`ProcessRef`], never a name), its parameters, its [`Source`], and a
//!   digest over all of it.
//!
//! # A candidate, not an applied change
//!
//! What a condition grants is a [`Candidate`]: a proposal the **one validator**
//! ([`BodyPhenotype::develop`](crate::phenotype::BodyPhenotype::develop)) can
//! lower, and nothing else. [`Candidate::propose`] builds an ordinary
//! [`AllocationProposal`] from it, which is why direct and automatic
//! arrangement cannot diverge here: there is one proposal shape and one
//! validator under it, and [`Arrangement`] is diagnostic metadata the validator
//! never reads.
//!
//! Discovering it is therefore **developmental availability**, and it is a
//! different fact from **expression** — the player still arranges it — and from
//! **inheritance**, which is [`Candidate::word`]: the lexicon entry a
//! descendant is born able to grow.
