//! What parts *do*, and what a body can do because of it.
//!
//! The first crossing of the bridge between anatomy and action. Before this,
//! a long limb was classified `Role::Limb` and produced nothing: reach was the
//! constant `REACH = 8` whatever a critter was shaped like.
//!
//! # Deliberately one capability
//!
//! The plan's stop rule is *do not add a broad process catalog before one path
//! is played*, and this is that one path. A process vocabulary authored ahead
//! of any consumer becomes a catalog, which is the Spore failure at a smaller
//! scale. Three processes existed here because one capability needed them; the
//! fourth arrived when something asked, and [`Process::Fix`] is that fourth —
//! the default creatures plan's DC1.5 needed a producer to be readable from
//! anatomy rather than from symmetry.
//!
//! # Grown and acquired are different (PD2)
//!
//! The first four are all things a shape simply *does*: grow the shape and the
//! process is there. [`Process::Secrete`] is the first that a body has to be
//! *given*, and that distinction is [`Seeding`]. Geometry seeds four
//! definitions and admits five, so the fifth is only ever where a development
//! put it — which is what makes expressing it a choice rather than a
//! consequence of having grown a plate.
//!
//! # Geometry seeds allocation; nobody edits a number
//!
//! P2's rule was *processes are read, not stored*: a part's processes were
//! derived from its geometry through [`classify`](crate::plan::classify) and
//! kept nowhere. PD1b keeps the principle and moves the boundary. Geometry is
//! now the **seeding rule** — [`Role::processes`] says what a shape expresses
//! when a part is developed — and what it seeds is
//! [allocation](crate::phenotype): tissue on a named part, occupying named
//! cells, citing the exact definition it expresses.
//!
//! The anti-Spore property survives the move intact, in two places. A
//! definition's [`ProcessDef::admits`] still gates every allocation by the
//! part's shape, so a proposal cannot put contraction on a plate; and
//! capability stays a reading over anatomy, allocation and environment rather
//! than a stored verdict. Reshaping a body still reshapes what it can do, and
//! there is still no ability field to raise.
