//! What a world has seen, and what it remembers of who did it.
//!
//! Significance is **abnormality measured against the world's own record**, so
//! there has to be a record. This is the smallest one that answers the
//! question, and its shape was chosen for a property that turns out to matter
//! more than its size.
//!
//! # It merges without a protocol
//!
//! Worlds fork, graft, and combine, so two records will need joining. This one
//! joins by taking the higher mark per axis, and that operation is
//! **commutative, associative, and idempotent**. Those three together make it a
//! join-semilattice, which means peers can hand each other records in any
//! order, twice, interleaved, and still converge. No coordination, no merge
//! protocol, no last-writer-wins.
//!
//! That is why this is a few integers rather than a search index. A text index
//! can be merged but its relevance stops meaning the same thing; a vector index
//! merges only if both sides embedded with the same model, which is the
//! ruleset-binding problem wearing a hat. **Mergeability is the requirement
//! that picks the structure**, not size.
//!
//! It is also the one place the wing's guidance actually calls for a
//! conflict-free type: introduce one only where a domain proves it needs
//! mergeable concurrent values. This domain proves it, and it is the trivial
//! case.
//!
//! # Thresholds forget, holders are retold
//!
//! A pure maximum forgets *who*. Beating a record would erase the name of
//! whoever held it, which is exactly the fact loss that makes a history feel
//! fake.
//!
//! So a [`Mark`] keeps both: the threshold as a maximum, and the holders of
//! *that* threshold as a set. Ties union, a higher mark replaces, and the set
//! stays small on its own without an arbitrary cap. Remembering every past
//! holder forever is the unbounded version, and it is the tulpa selector's
//! problem rather than this type's: codicil holds everything, tulpa holds what
//! is retold. Same rule, world scale.
//!
//! # What this does not answer
//!
//! Abnormality is a lookup: *has anyone reached this*. Significance in the
//! fuller sense is a traversal: *what later depended on this*, which is
//! `codicil`'s causal graph. Two questions, two structures, deliberately.
