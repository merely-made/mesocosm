//! How a body plan is generated: segments, tagmata, and a lexicon.
//!
//! Bodies were being sculpted, which is the wrong shape of answer: a sculpt
//! produces one creature and no relatives. Real body plans come from an
//! **axial recipe** read head to tail, and almost the whole animal kingdom is
//! variations on it:
//!
//! 1. **Segments** repeated along one axis (metamerism).
//! 2. **Serial homology**: every segment carries the same appendage machinery.
//! 3. **Tagmata**: segments group into a few named stretches.
//! 4. **Regional identity**: a stretch decides what its segments' appendages
//!    become, or suppresses them.
//!
//! Symmetry, which [`BodyPlan`](crate::plan::BodyPlan) already owns, is the
//! fifth. Together they generate centipedes, insects, spiders, tetrapods, and
//! snakes as parameter sets rather than as special cases, which the tests in
//! this module demonstrate against the real catalogue.
//!
//! # The mutations are the real ones
//!
//! Every edit here is a change biology actually makes. Fusing segment pairs
//! turns a centipede into a millipede. Raising the count and suppressing two
//! limb positions turns a tetrapod into a snake. And **changing a tagma's
//! appendage is homeosis**: *antennapedia*, the textbook Hox mutant that grows
//! legs where antennae belong, is one field of one [`Tagma`] in this type.
//!
//! # It composes, it does not replace
//!
//! [`BodyPlan`](crate::plan::BodyPlan) stays the *placement policy*: which
//! facing a role prefers, whether it mirrors, how much tolerance growth has.
//! This is the *scaffold* above it. The scaffold says a thoracic segment bears
//! a limb; the policy says which way a limb points.
//!
//! # Acquisition is Hox-like
//!
//! A lineage cannot express an appendage it has never eaten. The [`lexicon`]
//! is the set of appendage kinds a line has acquired, and incorporating a
//! creature teaches its kinds. So kleptoplasty is not a bolt-on part: eating
//! something **teaches your line a word**, and the plan decides where to say
//! it. That is why a plan carries a lexicon and refuses assignments outside
//! it.
//!
