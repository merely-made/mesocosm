//! These used to be `Morsel`s: inert matter with a mass, waiting to be

//! eaten. Mark's diagnosis: "we're just kinda munchin'. A free meal, talk
//! about the opposite of a game."
//!
//! An organism runs the same loop the player runs. It grows, matures,

//! one is a decision with a cost and a moment, because the thing in front of
