/// analogous organ — `Soil::draw_richest_within` reads a radius of columns and
/// takes the best one — so a consumer gets the same shape of read over what it
/// has: the sensory buckets, which the tick builds anyway.
///
/// **It is a gradient, not a second sight, and that is what keeps the raycast
/// gate honest.** The answer is a *bucket centre*, never a body: it says life
/// is denser that way and nothing else. Nothing here can be pursued, bitten, or
/// remembered — [`can_perceive`] still decides every one of those, and a body
/// that walks up a gradient into an occluded stand still sees nothing when it
/// arrives. The horizon is the span the body was already searching in with the
/// near cap taken off (bite reach, or the decomposer's), so no new number: a
/// body that bites at fifty also *smells* at fifty, which is the exact
/// asymmetry TD10's sixth finding named.
///
/// **It composes with the kinship discount** (TD10): a bucket's weight counts
/// only what this body would actually eat, and a body of the eater's own line
/// scores zero, so the gradient cannot point a cohort at itself. Distant kin,
/// whose remove has already halved away to nothing, count as ordinary pasture —
/// the same reading the bite makes.
///
/// **One voxel, as the random step was.** The caller walks the heading with a
/// single `grounded_step`, not the pursuit budget: a body with nothing in sight
/// is nearly out of reserve, and the pursuit budget charged it several
/// milligrams a tick to search. Measured on the way in — seed 1's decomposers
/// scavenged 4,220 mg against TD10's 197,347 and were gone by tick 200.
///
/// Returns `None` when the richest bucket is the one the body is standing in
/// (there is nothing to close distance to, so the caller's random step is the
