//! The tick's birth pass.
//!
//! Split out of `ecology.rs` on 2026-08-29 when TD6's matter cycle pushed that
//! file to the six-hundred-line ceiling — the same split-before-adding move
//! that put `ecology::tests`, `ecology::movement` and `ecology::rates` in files
//! of their own. What stayed next door is rent, feeding, dispersal and death;
//! what moved here is the one pass that makes a new body, which has its own
//! concerns: the filial stream, recipe realization, and the scatter.
