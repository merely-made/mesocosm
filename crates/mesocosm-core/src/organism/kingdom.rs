//! What a body makes its living by, read off the parts it feeds with.
//!
//! Split out of `organism.rs` at the 600-line ceiling when the reading stopped
//! being one line.
//!
//! # The unbinding (DC1.5)
//!
//! A kingdom used to be `body.plan.symmetry`, a bijection: radial was a
//! producer, bilateral a consumer, networked a decomposer. That made a body's
//! whole trophic life a consequence of the field that decides where a limb's
//! twin goes, and it meant no anatomy could disagree with it — you could not
//! grow a leaf and become a producer, or lose your mouth and stop being a
//! consumer. Symmetry is now geometry only and a kingdom is read from the
//! organs a body actually feeds with:
//!
//! | reading | anatomy |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`Kingdom::Producer`] | a plate stands in a canopy position — held above the body and unshadowed ([`BodyDocument::canopy`]) |
//! | [`Kingdom::Consumer`] | no fixing part, and the head bears a mouth |
//! | [`Kingdom::Decomposer`] | neither: it absorbs across its surface |
//!
//! and the consumer's mouth is read the same way, by shape:
//!
//! | reading | anatomy |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`FeedingMode::Predator`] | the mouth is `Limb`-classified — a jaw, which swings |
//! | [`FeedingMode::Grazer`] | the mouth is bulk — a crop, which does not |
//!
//! # Three things this reading deliberately does
//!
//! **It orders fixing ahead of the mouth.** A body carrying both organs is a
//! mixotroph, which the rulings register defers (§13): archetypes are
//! single-mode, so the precedence is stated rather than discovered, and the
//! founding draws never produce one.
//!
//! **It makes the decomposer the residual.** That is not a shrug — it is the
//! anatomy. A saprotroph has no ingesting organ: it digests outside itself and
//! takes the result in across its whole surface, which is exactly
//! [`Process::Intake`]'s own third clause ("a mouth, a gut, *an absorbing
//! surface*"), and every body's bulk segments already perform it. A decomposer
//! is the body that has nothing more specialised than that.
//!
//! **It reads a plate's position, not just its shape** (DC4). `Role::Plate` is
//! "fins, plates, leaves", and the three are not the same organ: what separates
//! a frond from a shell is where it hangs. [`BodyDocument::canopy`] carries the
//! exact rule, and it is what lets the roster wear armour.
//!
//! **It lets anatomy change a life.** Sever a grazer's mouth and it can no
//! longer take a living meal; graft a plate onto a consumer and it fixes. That
//! is the point of a reading rather than a field, and it is new behaviour —
//! see the plan's DC1.5 findings.
