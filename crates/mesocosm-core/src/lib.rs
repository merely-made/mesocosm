//! Mesocosm's simulation core.
//!
//! **The core owns game state; hosts only project it.** A host sends
//! [`Intent`]s and reads the world back. It never mutates world state, and it
//! never re-implements a rule.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! A [`World`] is a pure function of its seed and the ordered intents applied
//! to it. Three properties hold this up, and each is a constraint on anything
//! added here later:
//!
//! - **No ambient inputs.** No clock reads, no environment, no I/O.
//! - **No unordered iteration reaching the simulation.** Collections are
//!   ordered vectors, never hash maps.
//! - **All randomness from the seeded stream** in [`rng`].
//!
//! There is a fourth, and it is the one that buys the most: **the core is
//! integer-only.** Voxel coordinates, masses in milligrams, and quarter-turn
//! rotations are exact on every platform, so a replay cannot diverge on a
//! different machine's floating-point behaviour. Float physics belongs to a
//! host, on the far side of this boundary.
//!
//! One discipline buys five things, which is why it is worth the constraint:
//! co-op, replay, save/load, time-travel debugging, and comparing two hosts
//! are the same mechanism seen from different angles.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! ```text
//! World  ── seed + ordered intents ──▶ World'
//!   │
//!   ├── BodyDocument   parts, attachment frames, per-part provenance
//!   ├── Morsels        loose matter available to metabolize
//!   └── snapshot()     the whole world, captured in one call
