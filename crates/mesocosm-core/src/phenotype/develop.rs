//! One proposal, one validator, one atomic commit.
//!
//! # Two authors, not two biologies
//!
//! A player arranging a founder by hand and the game arranging one for an
//! unplayed lineage are **proposal sources over one developmental
//! authority** (plan §7). Both produce an [`AllocationProposal`]; both are
//! checked by [`BodyPhenotype::develop`](super::BodyPhenotype::develop);
//! neither can invoke a privileged mutation or skip a refusal the other would
//! receive. [`Arrangement`] rides along as diagnostic metadata and the
//! validator never reads it — which is why the parity receipt can assert that
//! the same candidate lowers to the same [`Instruction`] from both.
//!
//! # A complete desired state, not a series of drags
//!
//! A proposal names the parts it rewrites and the complete set of sites each
//! should end up with, so it is order-independent and a stale one is
//! refusable: it carries the digest of the phenotype it was authored against,
//! and a phenotype that moved underneath it refuses rather than applying a
//! plan for a body that no longer exists.
//!
//! # Atomic
//!
//! Validation runs to completion against a candidate before anything is
//! published. A refusal leaves body, allocation and revision byte-identical,
//! which is what keeps a multi-part development from half-landing.
