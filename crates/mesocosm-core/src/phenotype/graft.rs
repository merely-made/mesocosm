//! Lifting a branch out of one body and setting it into another. (P3)
//!
//! # The transfer in five steps, and where each of them lives
//!
//! The wing contract lists what a graft has to do. Four of the five are here:
//!
//! 1. the source operation names a living subtree — [`BodyPhenotype::harvest`];
//! 2. destination-local part ids are freshly allocated — every part goes
//!    through [`BodyPhenotype::attach`], which is the only allocator there is;
//! 3. internal parent relations are remapped to the new ids — the branch's own
//!    offsets and yaws are preserved and its parents are rewritten as they
//!    attach, so the branch arrives shaped the way it grew;
//! 4. the graft root attaches to one destination part — the caller resolves
//!    that site through the ordinary body plan;
//! 5. every destination part retains its source address —
//!    `Origin::Incorporated { from_species, from_part }` names **that part's**
//!    donor id, not the branch root's and not the donor's root.
//!
//! The fifth of the contract's steps, that severing the graft root later
//! removes the imported subtree, needs no code at all: the branch is attached
//! under one part, and `sever` already cascades.
//!
//! # Allocation moves through the one validator
//!
//! Attaching seeds each arriving part's mosaic from its own geometry, which is
//! what [`BodyPhenotype::attach`] has always done. What the *donor* had
//! allocated then arrives as one ordinary [`AllocationProposal`] over exactly
//! the grafted parts, lowered by [`BodyPhenotype::develop`]. So there is no
//! second attachment authority and no second developmental authority: a carried
//! arrangement that this body's rules would not accept is refused by the same
//! validator that would refuse it from an editor, and it is never substituted.
//!
//! [`AllocationProposal`]: super::AllocationProposal
