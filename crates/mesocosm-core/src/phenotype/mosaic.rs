//! One part's allocation mosaic: an authoritative graph of capacity cells.
//!
//! # There is no capacity scalar
//!
//! PD1a removed it. **Structural capacity is the number of living cells**, and
//! a site's allocation is the disjoint set of cells it occupies, so occupied
//! plus free equals capacity by construction rather than by two integers
//! agreeing. Conservation is countable, and [`Mosaic::conserves`] counts it.
//!
//! # The graph is authority; a layout is a projection
//!
//! Cells carry ids and adjacency, never coordinates and never renderer voxels.
//! The initial generator is a coarse orthogonal lattice whose axes follow the
//! part's `half_extent`, so a long limb is a chain and a plate is a sheet, and
//! adjacency is derived from the lattice's dimensions rather than stored per
//! cell — one graph, compactly written. A Diablo-like 2D inventory may draw the
//! same graph any way it likes; its screen coordinates are not authority.
//!
//! Admitting a different topology is itself a paid, ordered developmental
//! event, and [`Mosaic::neighbours`] is the seam it arrives through: every
//! reader already asks the mosaic for adjacency rather than doing lattice
//! arithmetic of its own.
//!
//! # Current availability is a separate question
//!
//! Mass, condition, starvation or a missing input may make allocated cells
//! ineffective without moving them. Nothing here evaluates that; ordinary
//! grazing does not shuffle organs. Irreversible loss is the other case, and
//! that tombstones cells through [`Mosaic::tombstone`].
