//! Snapshots and state hashing.
//!
//! A snapshot is the whole world, captured at once, by one call. That is the
//! property the wing's determinism constraint is for: hand-written per-field
//! capture has a failure mode, a field added later and not added to the
//! snapshot, that whole-state capture cannot have.
//!
//! The state hash is over the snapshot bytes, so two worlds hash equal exactly
//! when they would serialize equal.
