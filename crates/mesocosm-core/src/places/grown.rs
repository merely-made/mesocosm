//! The grown place graph: adjacency derived from the landscape.
//!
//! `Places::scatter` asserts a lattice, so every world is topologically the
//! same world (uniform interior degree, fixed diameter, no bridges, no dead
//! ends), and its links can disagree with the partition `at` answers from.
//! This module derives links from traversability over a [`Relief`]: you can
//! get between two regions if the ground between them permits it. Ridges
//! make chokepoints, basins make clusters, and no two worlds share a shape
//! unless they share a seed (plan §0.5).
//!
//! Additive on purpose: `scatter` and its serialized shape are untouched
//! while play is in flight. Genesis adopts this constructor by swapping one
//! call when its owner is ready.
