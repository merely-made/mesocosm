//! Brick truth: the ground as voxels, in the one coordinate space.
//!
//! G1's container (place-graph engine plan §3). The relief decides every
//! column's surface; nests carve real burrows under their hosts, so an
//! interior is a hole in the same ground everything walks on, never a
//! scene. Dense 8³ bricks in an ordered map: hashable, diffable, and
//! serialized flat. Carves mark their bricks dirty and bump one revision,
//! which is the fact a renderer's upload discipline consumes.
//!
//! Additive like [`super::grown`]: nothing here is wired into `World`
//! yet. Carve becomes an ordered intent at adoption time.
