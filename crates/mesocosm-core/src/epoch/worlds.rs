//! Worlds, and the pressures they put on the things living in them.
//!
//! **Authored, not generated.** Wave 2.2 rules three authored worlds rather
//! than procedural world generation, and the reason is diagnostic: an authored
//! world is legible enough to debug an ecology against, while a generated one
//! moves the question before it is answered. When a lineage does something
//! surprising here, the world is not a suspect.
//!
//! # The grammar begins with a question
//!
//! Taken from Exocosm's method: start with a question — life under high
//! gravity, on a tidally locked world, through a violent year — and *derive*
//! the niches from the pressures that question implies. A decorative biome
//! picked from a list produces decoration; a question produces consequences.
//!
//! So a [`WorldProfile`] records the question it was built from, the parameters
//! that answer it, and the pressures those parameters derive. The derivation is
//! the interesting part and is kept visible rather than folded into a constant.
//!
//! Exocosm is a worldbuilding reference, not a runtime dependency and not a
//! demand for astrophysical realism.
