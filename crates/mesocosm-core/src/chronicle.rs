//! What a creature is when it is not a body: a lineage, what it was made of,
//! and what happened to it.
//!
//! A body profile goes out; a chronicle comes back. Isometry does not return geometry, because the
//! wing's first law says morphology does not travel — what travels is choices
//! under scarcity. So a creature that goes to another game and lives a while
//! returns as a record, and this game regrows the body from it under its own
//! rules.
//!
//! # The protocol keystone, in three properties
//!
//! The founding record states it as **additive facts, opaque preservation,
//! deferred interpretation**. Each is a property of this type rather than a
//! convention around it:
//!
//! - **Additive.** [`append`](Chronicle::append) is the only way to change a
//!   chronicle. There is no edit and no delete, so no game can mutate another
//!   game's facts by accident, and set union is a legal merge.
//! - **Opaque preservation.** A [`Deed`] carries the appending game's own
//!   vessel name, its own verb, and a payload nobody else parses. This game
//!   keeps every deed it cannot read, byte for byte, and hands them back on
//!   the way out. Fact loss is the failure mode that makes a pipeline feel
//!   fake, and it happens by omission rather than by decision.
//! - **Deferred interpretation.** Re-entry is interpretation, not merging.
//!   Isometry writes "lost an arm at the ford" in Isometry's vocabulary; this
//!   game reads it and derives the *morphological* consequence itself, because
//!   only Mesocosm knows what an arm is here.
//!
//! # Why this is where Law C is proven
//!
//! Law C says the same seed format serves whether a creature was authored by
//! play or by RNG, and that the consuming game must not be able to tell them
//! apart structurally — only the player can, by pointing.
//!
//! That is a claim about *this type having no such field*, which is easy to
//! state and easy to violate later by adding a helpful `is_player_made` flag.
//! The generator in this module therefore produces chronicles with real
//! provenance, so a generated creature has a history of the same shape as a
//! played one, and `tests/proof_pair.rs` asserts the two are indistinguishable.
