//! The body as a tree: descent, depth, and loss.
//!
//! [`BodyDocument`] could always be climbed — `world_pivot` walks parents to
//! find where a part sits — but nothing could descend it. That made the wing's
//! anatomy rule inexpressible: **lose an arm, lose the hand, lose the
//! fingers**. You cannot cascade a loss through a tree you can only climb.
//!
//! # Severing tombstones rather than removes
//!
//! `PartId` is an index into [`BodyDocument::parts`], so deleting an entry
//! would renumber every part after it and silently reassign identities that
//! provenance, attribution grids, and other games' records all point at.
//!
//! So a severed part stays in the document with [`Part::severed`] set. Three
//! things fall out, and all three are wanted:
//!
//! - Ids stay stable, so a chronicle written before an injury still names the
//!   same parts afterwards.
//! - **What was lost is still on the record.** Law B wants a small number of
//!   very loud signatures, and a missing arm is exactly that. A body that
//!   forgot its injuries would be quietly less interesting.
//! - Regrowth can tell an empty socket from a place nothing ever grew.
//!
//! The cost is that every consumer of `parts` must skip the severed, which is
//! why [`BodyDocument::living`] exists and why the geometry passes use it.
