//! What a lineage commits, and what a descendant is born expressing. (P4, PD5)
//!
//! # A program, not a body
//!
//! **Ruled by Mark, 2026-08-03** (phenotype plan §3): the adaptation editor may
//! arrange a candidate body, but a lineage commits a **developmental program**,
//! never the candidate's literal allocation mosaic. So a [`Revision`] states
//! *declared sites* — a part role, an admitted definition, and a bounded number
//! of cells — and never a cell address or a body snapshot. Two descendants of
//! one revision may realize differently under different materials or grounds,
//! and that variance is expression of one inherited program rather than an
//! implicit mutation.
//!
//! This is the second of the ProcessDef plan's [three compiled
//! programs](../../design_docs/2026-08-01_processdef_plan.md): a **development
//! program**, run at a named discrete trigger, proposing through the existing
//! atomic validator. PE2 built the first (the condition program); the third is
//! [`ProcessDef`](crate::process::ProcessDef).
//!
//! # Revisions append; nothing edits one
//!
//! Epoch-boundary plan §2: every committed adaptation creates an **immutable
//! child revision**, and neither adopting nor branching edits the parent. So a
//! [`Program`] is an append-only list, every entry carries a digest over its
//! own rule-bearing bytes, and there is no `&mut Revision` anywhere.
//!
//! # The founding revision is stored nowhere
//!
//! What a body does with no program at all — allocation seeded from geometry —
//! *is* the founding revision. It has no parent, cites no discovery, and
//! declares no site, so writing it down would put a record in every snapshot
//! for the absence of one. [`Program::current`] answers `None` for it, and
//! nothing a world serializes moves until a line actually commits.
//!
//! # The ground charges what a line grows
//!
//! One declared condition decides how much of a revision a founder expresses,
//! and it is the game's own dormancy rule rather than a new number:
//! [`Organism::charged_mg`](crate::Organism::charged_mg) already says an
//! acquired process works only where the column under the body could replace
//! what it holds. [`Conditions::affords`] asks that at development time — a
//! line does not grow more than the ground it founds on can charge — which is
//! the same rule PD4's authored script reads, so the packed fixtures' rich and
//! lean grounds mean here what they mean there.
