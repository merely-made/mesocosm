//! Where the matter went.
//!
//! [`history`](crate::history) is biography: birth, feeding, growth, death, the
//! sparse causal line of a creature. Trophic visibility needs the other record —
//! exact, frequent resource movement — and putting every milligram of upkeep and
//! soil draw into the permanent causal log would make the wrong record carry the
//! wrong frequency (PE0, playable ecology plan §2).
//!
//! So there are two records and one commit point. `World::apply` emits both from
//! the same transaction: an accepted mutation emits its flows, a refused one
//! emits nothing at all. **A resource mutation cannot be visible to the state
//! while absent from the flow record** — `tests/flows.rs` reconciles the stream
//! against every compartment, tick by tick, which is that sentence made
//! executable.
//!
//! # Three compartments and one carrier
//!
//! TD6's conserved quantity is `soil + Σ(substance + reserve)`, so those are the
//! three [`Account`]s a milligram can sit in and every flow is a transfer
//! between two of them. [`Carrier`] has one variant today because matter is the
//! only thing the enclosure moves; PE4's generated materials are what it exists
//! to be extended by.
//!
//! # The envelope carries when and where
//!
//! [`Envelope`] stamps a record with its tick and its region rather than copying
//! those two fields into every event variant. `History` therefore finally has a
//! tick on it, which is what a bounded window over births and deaths needs.
//!
//! # It lives beside the world, never in it
//!
//! [`Ledger`] is the world's one-tick buffer, and it is `serde(skip)` and
//! transparent to equality — the [`drain_ground_dirty`] precedent. Draining
//! readings therefore cannot move the state hash, and a dense per-tick stream
//! cannot leak into a snapshot to serve a panel.
//!
