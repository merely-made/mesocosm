//! Where things happen.
//!
//! [`Scale`] has had three variants since the world record was built and no way
//! to tell them apart, because an enclosure was a continuous field of positions
//! with nowhere in it. `CROWD_CELL` looked like the missing piece and is not: it
//! is an eight-voxel bucket for counting neighbours, recomputed from scratch
//! every tick, with no identity to remember and no notion of what is next to
//! what.
//!
//! # A partition, and a graph over it
//!
//! Two facts are needed and they are not the same fact.
//!
//! Everything in the enclosure is somewhere, so places must **cover** it:
//! [`at`](Places::at) always answers. Sites are scattered one per cell of a
//! coarse grid, jittered inside it, and a position belongs to the nearest site.
//! Stratifying rather than scattering freely is what keeps regions from
//! collapsing into slivers, and the jitter is what keeps the result from looking
//! like the grid it came from.
//!
//! Places are also **next to** each other, and that is the half a partition
//! cannot express. Three places in a row and three scattered across the
//! enclosure are the same count and a different fact: one is a spread, the other
//! is an outbreak. Adjacency is the grid's, so the graph is connected by
//! construction and no seed can produce an enclosure with an unreachable corner.
//!
//! Height is not a place. The enclosure is a few voxels deep and nothing lives
//! in a layer, so places are x/z regions, which is the same reading
//! `organism::ecology` already takes of position.
//!
//! # Derived, like everything else that is a verdict
//!
//! A place has no name and no character of its own. What a place *is* comes from
//! what lives in it, which the world can compute at any moment and which changes
//! as the ecology does. Naming arrives with the reward that grants it, the same
//! promotion that makes a critter a borg and a lineage a species.
//!
//! # This is the wing's place granularity
//!
//! Isometry's `Overmap` is the same shape one vessel over: sites, links, and a
//! search across them. Kept separate rather than shared, because that one
//! carries travel weights and prepared maps and this one is a partition of a
//! continuous space. Two consumers of a shape is the bar for extracting it, and
//! these are not yet the same shape.
