//! Anatomy and allocation, held together.
//!
//! # Why a wrapper
//!
//! PD1a compared three owners for process allocation and ruled this one. The
//! two it rejected are worth keeping visible, because both are the shape this
//! file exists to prevent:
//!
//! - **Allocation fields inside [`Part`](crate::body::Part)** would make the
//!   structural anatomy document depend on Mesocosm's process semantics, and
//!   change the body-only bytes mesh, Lens and other vessels consume.
//! - **A freely mutable allocation state beside a freely mutable
//!   [`BodyDocument`]** permits exactly the split account PD0 spent a
//!   migration removing: a part attached, severed or restored without its
//!   allocation following.
//!
//! So both representations stay independently *readable* while every mutation
//! that affects both is one operation. The fields here are private and no
//! caller can obtain `&mut BodyDocument` from a live organism; body-only
//! authoring still uses `BodyDocument` directly, which keeps primitive
//! topology usable without loading the biology system.
//!
//! # The invariants
//!
//! - Every living part has exactly one mosaic, and every living allocation
//!   names a living part. The mosaics are index-aligned with
//!   `BodyDocument::parts`, so an anatomy tombstone **is** an allocation
//!   tombstone; they cannot disagree because there is nothing to synchronize.
//! - Every part's mosaic conserves capacity: occupied plus free equals the
//!   count of its living cells.
//! - Rearrangement happens only through [`BodyPhenotype::develop`], which
//!   validates a complete proposal, bumps the revision, and returns the record
//!   of what it did. There is no other way in.
//!
//! # Severing keeps history
//!
//! A severed part's mosaic stays addressable through [`BodyPhenotype::mosaic`]
//! so an injury is still explainable, and is excluded from
//! [`BodyPhenotype::allocations`] so it cannot contribute. Historical cells and
//! sites remain readable; they are not capacity and they express nothing.
