//! Reducing the flow record into what an account did. (DT2, DT3)
//!
//! Split out of `flow.rs` at the six-hundred-line ceiling, the same
//! split-before-adding move `world/` and `phenotype/` already made, and kept
//! growing there rather than back in `flow.rs` for the same reason.
//!
//! The dev lane's inspector needs what a *body* earned and spent, and
//! [`Score`](crate::Score) already separates exactly that for a *line*. The
//! split is written down once, here, so the two cannot come to disagree about
//! which side of the ledger a transfer is on. [`Account`]'s own two questions —
//! whether an account belongs to a body at all, and what the dev source has
//! issued — are reductions of the same kind and live beside it.
