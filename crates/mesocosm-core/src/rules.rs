//! What rules a world actually realized. (PD3)
//!
//! The playable ecology plan §2 asks a durable world to record its admitted
//! definitions, schedules, generator version and digests, because a seed alone
//! is insufficient once the code that reads it can change. `WorldRules` is that
//! record's working label, and this is its **first proven component**: the
//! digest of the [`Registry`](crate::process::Registry) a world was founded
//! under.
//!
//! # Identity, not a copy
//!
//! A world carries the digest, not the definitions. That is the same
//! arrangement `ProcessRef` already uses one scale down — a content address
//! rather than an inline copy — and it keeps a snapshot the size of a world
//! rather than the size of a world plus its biology. What the digest buys is
//! the refusal: a save restored against a ruleset that is not the one it ran
//! under is refused by name (`SnapshotError::Ruleset`) instead of quietly
//! simulating something else.
//!
//! # What is rule-bearing
//!
//! Everything [`Registry::digest`](crate::process::Registry::digest) folds,
//! and nothing else. Each definition contributes its identity, its site
//! requirement and its seeding; the set is folded in sorted order, so neither
//! the order a pack declared its files in nor a definition's plain label,
//! explanation text or native binding can move this number.
//!
//! # The second component: what ends an epoch (PE3)
//!
//! [`EpochRule`] is the first rule here that is not a digest, and it belongs
//! beside the ruleset for the same reason the ruleset does: a world that ended
//! its epochs on a different budget is a different game, and a save restored
//! against the wrong one would quietly re-time the whole run.
