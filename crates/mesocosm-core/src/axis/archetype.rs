//! Authored creatures: the bodies a world is meant to open holding.
//!
//! Sibling of [`catalogue`](super::catalogue) and its opposite in intent. The
//! catalogue's own doc says "these are reference points, not content" — it
//! exists to prove four axial rules reach a centipede. **This module is
//! content**: imagined creatures, each a [`Recipe`] plus the palette entries
//! its shapes need, developed by the same `Recipe -> Soma -> develop_body`
//! path every other body takes. Nothing here builds a [`BodyDocument`][b]
//! directly; an archetype that did would be the second simulation authority
//! `CLAUDE.md` forbids.
//!
//! # The roster
//!
//! Eight, per the plan's §4.2: three producers, three consumers, two
//! decomposers. Each is one idea followed through rather than a parameter
//! sweep.
//!
//! | tier | archetype | the idea |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | Producer | [`producer_mat`] | a low mat of flat pads lying over the ground |
//! | Producer | [`producer_shrub`] | two leaf sizes on one branching runner |
//! | Producer | [`producer_stalk`] | a long bare stem carrying one crown of big fronds |
//! | Consumer | [`consumer_browser`] | a long-necked hexapod that crops the stand |
//! | Consumer | [`consumer_pursuit`] | a short-bodied sprinter with a swinging jaw |
//! | Consumer | [`consumer_armoured`] | a small cropper wearing its plates as covering |
//! | Decomposer | [`decomposer_crust`] | a flat creeper whose pads lie in the litter |
//! | Decomposer | [`decomposer_detritivore`] | an eight-legged walker that finds the dead |
//!
//! # What the ruled framing does to them
//!
//! The terrarium section looks along `-z` and [`develop_body`] chains segments
//! along `+z`, so **the game's own camera draws every one of these bodies
//! end-on**. That is presentation rather than anatomy and it is recorded as a
//! finding; the receipts turn the slab a quarter to show the body plans.
//!
//! [`develop_body`]: crate::development::develop_body
//!
//! # What each reads as, and why
//!
//! Kingdom is a reading of feeding anatomy (`organism/kingdom.rs`), so an
//! archetype does not declare a tier — it grows the organs that make one. The
//! producers carry plates **in canopy positions**; the consumers carry a mouth
//! under the head and nothing lit; the decomposers carry neither.
//!
//! **Armour is a position, not a shape** (DC4). [`consumer_armoured`] and
//! [`decomposer_crust`] both wear plates, and neither reads Producer, because
//! their plates hang on the flanks rather than being held up.
//!
//! # Senses
//!
//! **Every fauna archetype carries working eyes and something that contracts**,
//! which is the ruling this plan was founded on. The three producers are
//! sightless and sessile, deliberately: a plant has no eyes, and a body with
//! no `Sense` and no `Contract` part reads a build multiple of exactly 1, which
//! is what makes the stand free at the ecology scale (plan §2.4).
//!
//! # No names
//!
//! The identifiers are role-descriptive. Naming rounds in this repo carry
//! crates.io / game / studio / trademark checks and are Mark's; a founding
//! lineage is also deliberately unnamed (`species.rs`: "they were there before
//! anybody arrived to name them").
//!
//! [b]: crate::body::BodyDocument
//!
//! # The palette is world state and the recipe is the program
//!
//! An archetype is therefore two halves that live in different places. Its
//! *shapes* go in [`palette`], which a world snapshots; its *arrangement* goes
//! in the recipe, which a lineage carries. Every shape below is added in a
//! spare [`RoleShapes`](crate::development::RoleShapes) slot — no default
//! moves — so a tier that still draws from [`seed`](super::seed) develops
//! exactly the body it developed before.
