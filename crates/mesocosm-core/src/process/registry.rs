//! The admitted ruleset: every process definition this world holds. (PD3)
//!
//! Split out of `process.rs` at the 600-line ceiling when PD3 widened
//! [`ProcessId`] to owned strings and gave admission a door.
//!
//! # Canonical, so declaration order is not a rule
//!
//! A registry's definitions are sorted by qualified id and no id appears
//! twice. That is what lets a pack's manifest list its files in any order and
//! still lower to the same ruleset: the order a pack was written in is an
//! authoring convenience, and [`Registry::digest`] is order-independent on top
//! of that, folding the *sorted* definition digests rather than the vector's.
//!
//! The native table below is written in the same canonical order, so a pack
//! that encodes exactly these definitions admits to a registry that is `==` to
//! [`Registry::native`] rather than merely digest-equal. That equality is
//! PD3's parity receipt.
