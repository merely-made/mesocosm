//! What each lineage did, measured at the end of an epoch.
//!
//! [`WorldRecord::note`](crate::record::WorldRecord::note) was built first
//! because its *shape* was the question, and it has had no callers since. This
//! is the caller. It is last rather than first because a reckoning needs all
//! three of the other pieces at once: the log to read what happened, the species
//! tree to have lineages worth telling apart, and places for [`Scale`] to mean
//! anything.
//!
//! # Read, never accumulated
//!
//! Nothing here is a counter the simulation maintains. Every figure is computed
//! from the world and its past when the epoch ends, which is the same discipline
//! capability, temperament, and the possibility space already run on: a stored
//! verdict drifts from the facts it was drawn from, and a derived one cannot.
//!
//! # Predation is the log paying for itself
//!
//! Taking from the living and taking from the dead are the same [`Event::Fed`],
//! and the difference between a predator and a scavenger is **only** answerable
//! because the log preserves order: a meal counts as predation when no `Died`
//! about that creature came before it. A tally kept as the world ran could have
//! recorded this too. Nothing else could have recovered it afterwards, and
//! everything else about the past would have needed its own counter.
//!
//! # Two axes stay empty, deliberately
//!
//! Nothing in the world yet gives to another creature or changes the enclosure
//! itself, so `Symbiosis` and `Construction` are never noted. That is worth
//! more than a zero: `untouched` answers *has anyone ever* rather than *how
//! much*, and a lineage that first does either takes an axis no world has
//! touched. Writing zeroes would fill the record with feats nobody performed and
//! silence the question permanently.
