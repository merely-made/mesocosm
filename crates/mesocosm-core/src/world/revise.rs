//! Committing a lineage revision. (P4)
//!
//! **One transaction, two doors.** [`Intent::Revise`](super::Intent) is the
//! played one and this is what it calls; an unplayed lineage reaches
//! [`World::revise`] directly, so the two take the identical path and neither
//! can be a second way for a program to move. Nothing here edits a revision:
//! [`Program::commit`](crate::program::Program::commit) appends, which is the
//! epoch-boundary plan §2 rule made structural.
//!
//! # What a revision is built from
//!
//! The discovery the line came to, and nothing a host said. A [`Candidate`]
//! already names *which admitted process, on what shape, at what bounded
//! capacity* — the three rule-bearing fields a declared site holds — so
//! committing needs no second vocabulary and a host cannot smuggle a cell
//! address or a price through the door.
//!
//! [`Candidate`]: crate::discovery::Candidate
