//! The review's own claims, in a bare world. (PE3b)
//!
//! A world nobody has played holds no discovery, so every row here is the
//! status quo — which is exactly the case worth pinning at this scale: the
//! table is never empty, the figures reproduce, and the preview is the one
//! `Species::preview` answers. What a *candidate* row does needs a line that
//! has come to something, which is an embodied claim and lives in
//! `tests/embodied/review.rs`.
