//! Taking one organ off a carcass. (PE2)
//!
//! **One bounded proof, and the bound is the point.** The playable ecology plan
//! asks part-level eating to start with a single claim: consuming a corpse part
//! settles *that part's* exact matter and donor evidence, and cannot teach
//! unrelated parts from the donor's recipe. It explicitly does **not** attach a
//! functioning source branch — live subtree transfer is phenotype P3 — and full
//! live dismemberment is not a prerequisite for it.
//!
//! # Why a corpse, and not a severed branch on a living body
//!
//! Both are in the plan's sentence, and only one of them conserves matter
//! today. A severed part is tombstoned: `BodyDocument::total_mass_mg` already
//! skips it, so its milligrams have left the conservation account, and eating
//! one would *create* matter. A corpse's living parts still weigh what they
//! weigh. So this verb takes an unsevered part off something that is no longer
//! alive, and the severed half waits for the dismemberment gate (phenotype D3a)
//! that would put those milligrams somewhere honest in the first place.
//!
//! # It is not the meal verb wearing a part
//!
//! [`Intent::Metabolize`](super::Intent::Metabolize) is still how a body eats
//! for calories, and the body still routes it. This is a deliberate act on a
//! named organ: it always incorporates, and a body with nowhere to put the
//! organ refuses rather than quietly burning it. That is what makes the
//! provenance it writes worth writing — `Origin::Incorporated { from_part }`
//! finally names the part it came off rather than the donor's root.
