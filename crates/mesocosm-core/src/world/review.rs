//! The played line's own turn: what it could commit, what each would cost, and
//! what a founder under it would look like. (PE3b)
//!
//! [`World::adapt_round`](crate::World) skips the played line because its turn
//! is the review. This is the reading that turn is made of — the same
//! candidates, scored by the same function, priced by the same expression a
//! birth pays, previewed through the same realization. A panel draws it; it
//! decides nothing.
//!
//! # Every figure here is somebody else's, asked once
//!
//! Nothing below invents a number. The score is [`World::score`], which is what
//! an unplayed line's turn is decided by. The price is
//! [`Filial::cost_mg`](crate::Filial) off
//! [`program::express`](crate::program::express) — literally the milligrams the
//! next descendant will pay out of its reserve and into the ground under it.
//! The preview is [`Species::preview`](crate::Species). The refusal is
//! [`Unexpressed`], carried whole rather than restated. A review that computed
//! its own version of any of them would be a second authority over what a
//! candidate is worth.
//!
//! # The status quo is a row
//!
//! `candidate: None` is the founding revision, or whatever the line has already
//! committed: no change, scored the same way, priced at what a descendant is
//! already paying. *Nothing beat what I have* is therefore something the player
//! reads off the table rather than infers from an absence — the same rule
//! [`Turn::considered`](super::Turn) already keeps for an unplayed line.
//!
//! # A candidate that cannot be taken is the ordinary case
//!
//! PE2's residue, answered here: a bulk consumer has nowhere to put a gland
//! until its line grows a plate, so an offer carries [`Untakeable`] and stays on
//! the table. Hiding it would leave a player unable to tell *this world has
//! nothing for me* from *this body is the wrong shape for it, yet*.
//!
//! # The budget is the founder's material, and it is real
//!
//! **Ruled flat** (epoch boundary plan §8 q4, 2026-09-01): committing a
//! revision costs nothing, and the descendant pays the ordinary development
//! price. So the finite thing a review is spending against is not an invented
//! currency but [`Conditions::material_mg`] — what a founder of this line will
//! have banked when it is born, which is the ecology's own provisioning rule
//! (`parent.energy_mg.min(parent.biomass_mg() / OFFSPRING_COST)`) and the
//! number [`Unexpressed::Unaffordable`] already refuses against. The other
//! candidate, the line's living bodies' reserves summed, was not taken: no
//! rule anywhere spends it, so a budget read off it would be a figure the game
//! never charges.
