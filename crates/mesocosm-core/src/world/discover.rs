//! Where the world offers evidence, and what it keeps of the answer. (PE2)
//!
//! [`crate::discovery`] owns the rules; this owns the two things only a world
//! can supply — the **authoritative accumulator** a sustained-stress condition
//! reads, and the consequences a landed discovery has on the line.
//!
//! # Played-only, and structurally so
//!
//! Both routes into [`World::observe`] are the played critter's: a meal is an
//! ordered intent somebody sent, and the hunger run only advances while
//! [`World::held`] says a hand is on the body — the same gate PE1's checkpoint
//! uses, for the same reason. An idle terrarium is therefore never asked
//! anything and never discovers anything, which is why the population
//! instrument cannot observe this phase at all.
//!
//! The *evidence* is organism-neutral: nothing in [`crate::discovery::Evidence`]
//! names the player. Whether unplayed lineages acquire through the same rules is
//! open (playable ecology plan §6, ruling 5); what it would need is a per-body
//! accumulator (or a declared cohort reduction for it) and a proposal sink in
//! the ecology's own step, not a second evaluator.
