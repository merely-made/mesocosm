//! The four world-changing dev intents. (DT3)
//!
//! **None of these has its own physics.** That is the dev tools plan's stop
//! rule and it is the whole design of this file: every one of the four is a
//! validator in front of a transaction that already existed and is already
//! reached by something else.
//!
//! | Intent | The transaction it invokes | Also reached by |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `EndEpoch` | the boundary block in [`World::apply`] | a spent `Timed` budget |
//! | `ForceBirth` | [`ecology::bear`] | the tick's birth pass |
//! | `Kill` | [`ecology::perish`] | starving, and ageing out |
//! | `PlaceMatter` | `Soil::deposit` plus a recorded transfer | every return to the ground |
//!
//! So there is nothing here that decides what a birth costs, what a corpse
//! weighs, or when a round runs. What is here is the refusals — because a dev
//! tool that failed silently would be worse than no tool — and the one thing
//! that is genuinely new: the account matter enters the enclosure through.
//!
//! # They are ordinary intents in every other respect
//!
//! Applied through [`World::apply`] like every other, recorded in the trace,
//! refused by name into the same `Outcome::Rejected`, and conserving matter to
//! the milligram. A run that used one replays to the same hash as the run that
//! recorded it, which is what makes the receipt's "assisted" label a claim
//! about the *run* rather than about the simulation's honesty.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! No `Event` variant of its own. A forced birth writes the ordinary
//! `Event::Born` and a dev kill the ordinary `Event::Died`, from inside the
//! shared transaction — one record, one writer, the arrangement
//! `Outcome::Revised` already uses. Nothing about the record says a hand was
//! involved, which is the point: the DT2 tile, the succession lane and the
//! flow reconciliation all read a dev-caused death exactly as they read a
//! natural one.
//!
//! [`ecology::bear`]: crate::organism::ecology::bear
//! [`ecology::perish`]: crate::organism::ecology::perish
