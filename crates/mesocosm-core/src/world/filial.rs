//! What a birth does with its line's program. (PD5)
//!
//! The ecology's birth pass realizes the recipe and seeds allocation from
//! geometry — **the founding revision**, and what every birth in this world
//! does until a line commits one. This is the tick's other half: a descendant
//! of a line that has committed a revision is developed under it, here, before
//! anything reads the world.
//!
//! # Through the one validator, and paid for
//!
//! Nothing here arranges tissue.
//! [`program::express`](crate::program::express) builds the same
//! [`AllocationProposal`](crate::AllocationProposal) `candidate_proposal`
//! builds and offers it to
//! [`BodyPhenotype::develop`](crate::BodyPhenotype::develop), so a descendant
//! expressing its program and a player expressing a discovery reach one
//! developmental authority. The price is PD2's, unchanged: cells whose
//! expression changed, at the part's own cell price, out of the child's reserve
//! and into the column under it. Rebuilding an organ is work, and work in this
//! world is matter moving somewhere else. (TD6)
//!
//! # A refusal is a named fact
//!
//! A child body with no part of the declared shape, or too little banked to pay
//! for one, is **born anyway** — under geometry seeding — and the record says
//! which revision it could not express and why. That is PE2's residue one
//! generation down: a candidate that cannot be taken is the ordinary case, and
//! a silent fallback would make an inherited program unfalsifiable.
//!
//! # Unplayed lineages take this path
//!
//! Nothing below reads [`World::controlled`](crate::World::controlled). The
//! pass runs over every organism the tick's birth pass allocated an id for, so
//! a descendant of an NPC line is developed by the identical code.
