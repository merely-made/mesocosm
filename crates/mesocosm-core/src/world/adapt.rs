//! The lineage turn: what a line could commit, what growing it would be worth,
//! and what it decides. (P4b, PE3a)
//!
//! # A candidate is scored by growing it, never by a formula
//!
//! **Ruled by Mark, 2026-09-01.** A candidate is worth what it earns: the world
//! is copied, the revision is committed on the candidate's line in the copy, the
//! copy is grown for a bounded run with nobody at the keyboard, and the flow
//! record is read — income against rent, for that line's bodies. There is no
//! static formula over body readings, no fitness term, and no number invented
//! here. [`Score`] is the figures the record already separates plus the run
//! length, and the comparison between two of them is
//! [`Score::beats`] and nothing else.
//!
//! The copy is discarded. Scoring takes `&self`, so it cannot reach the world it
//! is reasoning about, and the receipt asserts the real world's hash is the same
//! afterwards.
//!
//! # Initiative is descending complexity, and commits land immediately
//!
//! [`crate::epoch`]'s ordering idea, kept and brought over to the real world
//! model: the most elaborate lines commit first and the simpler ones answer a
//! world those commits have already changed. What is not brought over is that
//! module's trait array and its `fitness`, which this replaces. The reading is
//! `Species::recipe.complexity()` — the same one [`World::intricacy`] reads and
//! the complexity frontier binds on — ties broken by species id so a round
//! replays identically.
//!
//! # Nothing here knows which lineage is the player's, except to skip it
//!
//! Every unplayed line takes its turn through [`World::revise`], the identical
//! transaction a player's `Intent::Revise` reaches. The played line is left
//! alone: its turn is the review, and the review is PE3b.
//!
//! # The reckoning is not here, and that is the split
//!
//! [`World::apply`] ends the epoch — the Timed rule is a versioned world rule,
//! so a headless enclosure obeys it too — and runs the round. What it does not
//! do is *reckon*: [`World::reckon`] reads the past, and history lives beside a
//! world rather than inside it, so whoever holds the past does that half.
//!
//! # One boundary, one door (DT4)
//!
//! There used to be a second one. `World::end_epoch(history)` reckoned, bumped
//! the epoch and restarted the budget — but it never ran the adaptation round
//! and it left `at_boundary` *false*, so an epoch closed through it gave the
//! unplayed lines no turn and stood at no lineage checkpoint. The boundary
//! block in [`World::apply`] does both. Two doors that disagreed about what a
//! boundary is are one authority too many, so the manual one is **deleted**:
//! the epoch ends when the world's own rule says so, or when a hand asks
//! through `Intent::EndEpoch`, and both are that block. A caller that wants the
//! epoch closed now applies the intent; a caller that wants to know what an
//! epoch came to calls [`World::reckon`], which is the read-the-past half and
//! was always separate.
//!
//! # What an unplayed line may consider
//!
//! **Inherited or already-discovered candidates only** (playable ecology plan
//! §6, ruling 5, still open at the acquisition end). Discovery is played-only
//! and stays that way: [`World::candidates`] reads the discoveries this world
//! holds and nothing proposes a new one. So an enclosure nobody has played has
//! nothing for any line to weigh, and its rounds are empty.
