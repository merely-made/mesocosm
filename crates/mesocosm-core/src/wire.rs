//! Framing for everything this game writes for somebody else to read.
//!
//! The wing couples its vessels **by data, not by types**, which trades a
//! compile error for a runtime one. The reader therefore has to be the thing
//! that notices, and it has to notice *before* it decodes.
//!
//! # Why the header is outside the payload
//!
//! Postcard is positional: no field tags, no self-description. A version field
//! *inside* the serialized struct is unreachable exactly when it is needed —
//! once the layout changes, the decoder cannot get to the field that would have
//! told it to refuse. It fails as a malformed decode, or worse, succeeds and
//! returns plausible nonsense.
//!
//! So every artifact starts with a fixed 10-byte header that never changes
//! shape: an 8-byte magic naming the schema, and a little-endian `u16` version.
//! Both are readable without decoding anything, which is what makes
//! [`WireError::UnknownVersion`] a diagnosis rather than a guess.
//!
//! One framing, used by every schema, so the refusal contract is written once
//! and every reader in the wing behaves the same way.
