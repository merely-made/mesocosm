//! TD4: the hand, and what happens when it stops.
//!
//! The first real playtest's complaint was that no keypress ever displaced the
//! critter — the ecology was spending its budget wandering it around while the
//! player pressed keys at it. The answer Mark ruled on 2026-08-29 is not to
//! exempt the played body from the ecology: it is to give the hand the body
//! **while the hand is there**, and give it back when the hand goes still.
//! The idle terrarium is the feature, not the failure.
//!
//! Everything here is a function of the trace, which is why it can live in the
//! world at all: count the trailing idles and you know who is driving.
