//! **A refused transaction reaches neither record.**
//!
//! Split out of `flows.rs` at the six-hundred-line ceiling, beside `boundary`,
//! `transfers` and `dev`, and sharing the same harness for the reason they all
//! do: two files reconciling ticks two different ways is how they would come to
//! disagree.
//!
//! It is one claim, and it is the other half of the file's own sentence.
//! Accepted and refused intents cannot disagree with the stream because they
//! share a commit point: the accepted branch emits both records, the refused one
//! returns before reaching either. `dev.rs` next door makes the same claim
//! about DT3's four.
