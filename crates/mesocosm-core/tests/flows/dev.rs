//! The four dev intents, read against the ledger. (DT3)
//!
//! Split out of `flows.rs` at the 600-line ceiling, beside `boundary` and
//! `transfers`, and the harness is next door and shared for the reason those
//! two share it: two files reconciling ticks two different ways is how they
//! would come to disagree.
//!
//! What is separately worth showing here is the one transfer in the game that
//! brings matter in from *outside* the enclosure. Every other flow moves a
//! milligram between two of TD6's three compartments; a placement comes out of
//! [`Account::Dev`], and the claim is that naming that source is what keeps the
//! soil's gain claimed rather than unexplained.
