//! The epoch boundary, read against the ledger. (PE3a)

//! Split out of `flows.rs` at the 600-line ceiling, the same way
//! `transfers.rs` was. Ending an epoch runs a whole adaptation round *inside*
//! a tick — every unplayed line grows its candidates in copies of this world
//! and the winners commit — and none of that may move a milligram of the
//! enclosure. The harness is next door and shared, because two files
//! reconciling ticks two different ways is how they would come to disagree.
