//! **Death is a hinge, not a wall.** PE1's core half: descent is readable off
//! the record the breeding transaction already writes, an eligible descendant
//! can be inhabited when a body ends, and the siblings that were not chosen go
//! on living in the enclosure rather than becoming a list.
//!
//! Nothing here is a second breeding system. Every birth below comes out of
//! `ecology::breeding` — the adult-mass gate, the filial realization, the
//! matter debit and the parent link exactly as they were. What the tests do is
//! put a critter in a state the ecology reaches on its own (mature, past
//! gestation) and then read what the ordinary tick produces, which is the same
//! move `ecology`'s own unit tests make.
//!
//! The unforced end-to-end proof — a natural death at the end of a lifespan,
//! followed by the line continuing — is the recorded demo trace, and it is
//! receipted in `mesocosm-genet`.
