//! The founding record says the proof pair must "import a played critter and an
//! RNG critter through the same profile and confirm the consuming game cannot
//! tell them apart structurally. Only the player can, by pointing."
//!
//! So one half of this file plays a critter — really plays it, by driving the

//! one. Then it checks that nothing downstream can separate them except by
//! reading the record and recognising it.
//!
//! The rest of the file covers the protocol keystone the return direction
//! rests on: **additive facts, opaque preservation, deferred interpretation**.
