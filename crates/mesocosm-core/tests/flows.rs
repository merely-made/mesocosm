//! **The flow stream accounts for what the compartments did.** PE0's
//! load-bearing invariant, and the executable form of the plan's sentence: *a
//! resource mutation cannot be visible to the state while absent from the flow
//! record.*
//!
//! `matter.rs` next door proves the other half — that the enclosure's total is
//! constant — and would still pass if every milligram moved in silence. This
//! one reads the two records against each other: for every tick, and every
//! account of every body, the recorded transfers must sum to exactly the change
//! the world made. A seam that mutates without emitting fails here even though
//! conservation holds.
//!
//! # The instrument is proved, not assumed
//!
//! [`reconcile`] is handed a doctored tick as well as honest ones, and must
//! report it. An absence is evidence only beside a positive control.
