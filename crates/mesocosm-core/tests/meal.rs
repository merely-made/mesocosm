//! P0: where a meal goes, and TD4: who decides.
//!
//! Before P0, eating granted a part **and** half the mass as energy, so the
//! game's central verb asked the player nothing. P0 split the destination:
//! live now, or grow later. These tests still pin that tradeoff — mutually
//! exclusive receipts, consistent venom, identical replay.
//!
//! What changed on 2026-08-29 is who answers. Mark rejected the hotkey pair as
//! an interface, and TD4 ruled the answer diegetic: **the body routes the
//! meal.** A critter inside `STARVED_UPKEEP_TICKS` of an empty budget burns;
//! one with room to spare builds. So these tests no longer choose a route,
//! they choose a *state*, which is the same choice moved to where it is
//! played from.
