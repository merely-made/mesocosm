//! PE3a: the round, in a world. One lineage turn, end to end.
//!
//! Split out of `lineage.rs` at the 600-line ceiling. What lives next door is
//! P4a and PD5 — what a *commit* is and what a birth makes of one; what lives
//! here is the epoch boundary running that commit on its own, for a line
//! nobody is holding, off a score nobody wrote down in advance.
//!
//! The scorer's own claims — determinism, the untouched hash, the ordering —
//! are unit tests beside it in `src/world/adapt/tests.rs`. This is the join.
