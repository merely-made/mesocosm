//! PD2: one native played process, in its four states.
//!
//! The gate's whole specification is four claims, and there is one test for
//! each of them here:
//!
//! 1. **acquiring or expressing it creates a readable choice** — nothing grows
//!    a gland, so having one means a development took tissue off what the part
//!    was already doing, and converting a whole frond costs a body its living;
//! 2. **allocation locates it on a part and charges its cost** — a named part,
//!    a counted number of cells, a milligram out of the reserve and into the
//!    ground, and a standing rent from then on;
//! 3. **world conditions can make it useful or dormant** and
//! 4. **severing its dependency removes the consequence** are next door in
//!    `gland_use.rs`, split off at the 600-line ceiling. The fixtures below
//!    are shared with it.
//!
//! # Two routes, since PD3 deleted the editor operation
//!
//! PD2 proved these through `Intent::Rearrange`, which carried a complete
//! hand-authored allocation. That door is gone: `Intent::Express` names a
//! discovered condition, and the arrangement comes from the admitted ruleset
//! and the discovery record. So each claim here goes through whichever
//! boundary actually decides it — the world door for what a development costs
//! and records, [`develop_played`](super::develop_played) for what a body a
//! host could never author *is*. One validator underneath both, unchanged.
