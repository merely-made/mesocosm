//! P4 and PD5: a line commits a program, and its descendants are born under it.
//!
//! One test per claim:
//!
//! 1. **the founding program changes no birth** — a line that has committed
//!    nothing grows exactly the body geometry seeded, and no filial record is
//!    written for it;
//! 2. **a revision is immutable** — a second commit appends and names its
//!    parent, and the first is byte-identical afterwards;
//! 3. **a birth expresses the revision through the one validator** — and pays
//!    for it out of its own reserve, into the column under it;
//! 4. **a refusal is a named fact** — a child with nowhere to put it is born
//!    anyway, and the record says which revision and why;
//! 5. **a founder preview is deterministic**, and
//! 6. **the same program under two grounds grows two bodies** — same program
//!    digest, different phenotype digests;
//! 7. **an unplayed lineage takes the same path**;
//! 8. **somatic incorporation, dormant acquisition and filial expression are
//!    three records**;
//! 9. the commit's own refusals, by name.
