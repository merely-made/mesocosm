//! PD2's other two states: what a gland is worth, and what losing it costs.
//!
//! Split out of `gland.rs` at the 600-line ceiling when PD3 re-expressed the
//! suite through `Intent::Express`. The four claims are one gate and the
//! fixtures are shared, so this file takes the two that are about the world
//! around the body rather than about the development itself:
//!
//! 3. **world conditions can make it useful or dormant** — a gland makes its
//!    toxin out of the ground under the body, and goes dry where that ground
//!    cannot supply what it holds, without losing a cell or a milligram of
//!    rent;
//! 4. **severing its dependency removes the consequence** — and the branch can
//!    still say what it used to do.
