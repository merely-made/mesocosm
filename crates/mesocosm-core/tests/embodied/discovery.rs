//! PE2: discovery becomes an embodied option.
//!
//! One test per named claim in the gate:
//!
//! 1. **one condition unrelated to food unlocks a candidate** — coming through
//!    the starvation horizon grants the gland, and no meal is anywhere in it;
//! 2. **one meal supplies evidence without unlocking an incompatible
//!    candidate** — the evidence is recorded, the condition that never declared
//!    the meal lane cannot be reached by it, and the donor's other recipe words
//!    are not taught;
//! 3. **one consumed part settles only its own matter and provenance** — the
//!    organ's exact milligrams move, its children keep theirs, and
//!    `from_part` finally names the part it came off;
//! 4. **the PD2 process, re-receipted through the discovery route** — located,
//!    paid for, useful, dormant, and lost with its branch, reached from a
//!    condition rather than from PD2's temporary fixture;
//! 5. **direct and automatic fixtures use the same validator** — one candidate,
//!    two proposal sources, one instruction.
