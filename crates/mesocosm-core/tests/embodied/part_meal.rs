//! PE2's part-level meal: what one organ off a carcass does and does not do.
//!
//! Split out of `discovery.rs` at the 600-line ceiling. Two of the gate's
//! named claims live here:
//!
//! - **one meal supplies evidence without unlocking an incompatible
//!   candidate** — the evidence is recorded, the condition that never declared
//!   the meal lane cannot be reached by it, and the donor's other recipe words
//!   are not taught;
//! - **one consumed part settles only its own matter and provenance** — the
//!   organ's exact milligrams move, its children keep theirs, and `from_part`
//!   finally names the part it came off.
//!
//! The fixtures are next door, because the two files are two halves of one
//! claim and duplicating a carcass builder is how they would drift.
