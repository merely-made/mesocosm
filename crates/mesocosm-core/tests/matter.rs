//! **Total matter is conserved.** TD6's load-bearing invariant.
//!
//! The enclosure has a finite matter budget: producers draw out of the soil
//! column they stand on, rent and travel and decay put it back where the body
//! is, a death releases the reserve it was carrying, and the player's deposit
//! enriches the ground. Light is the one open input, and light is not matter.
//! So the sum of soil, living substance, carrion, and banked reserves is a
//! constant of a run, and mass cannot run away because it has to be somewhere.
//!
//! # Exceptions
//!
//! None. There is no documented sink or source in the tick or in any intent —
//! that is what the checks below assert, milligram-exact, tick by tick, rather
//! than within a tolerance that would hide one.
//!
//! Two things deliberately outside the account, because they are not matter:
//!
//! - **Light.** A producer's income is drawn from soil; the free energy that
//!   powers the drawing never enters the ledger. This is the ruling.
//! - **Ground bricks.** [`Ground`](mesocosm_core::places::Ground) is what is
//!   solid and walkable; the soil store is what can be eaten out of the floor.
//!   Carving air changes the first and not the second, which is why
//!   `Intent::Carve` moves no matter and is checked here saying so.
//!
//! # The instrument is proved, not assumed
//!
//! An absence is evidence only beside a positive control in the same run, so
//! [`conserved`] — the exact check the long runs use — is also handed a world
//! with a conjured milligram and a leaked one, and must report both.
