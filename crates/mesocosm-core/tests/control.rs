//! P1: one organism model, and control as a recorded pointer.
//!
//! Before this the played critter was a `BodyDocument`, a position, and an
//! energy budget living on `World`, beside a vector of scalar organisms that
//! had none of those things. Anatomy could not constrain an unplayed creature,
//! prey had no parts to lose, and switching lineage would have meant rebuilding
//! state.
//!
//! The claim these tests pin is that **the played critter is an ordinary
//! organism that happens to be pointed at**, that nothing in the rules can tell
//! the difference, and that the pointer moves only through a recorded intent.
