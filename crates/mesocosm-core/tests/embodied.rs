//! Reach used to be `const REACH: i32 = 8`. A twelve-limbed creature and a
//! single cube touched exactly as far, `Role::Limb` was classified and never
//! consulted, and anatomy was decoration.
//!
//! These tests pin the claim that **what a critter can do is read off what it
//! is made of**: two bodies reach differently because of their shapes, severing
//! the part responsible takes the ability with it, and a refusal says which
//! embodied requirement went unmet. Nothing here edits a capability number,
//! because there is no capability number to edit.
