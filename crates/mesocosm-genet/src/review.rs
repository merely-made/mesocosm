//! The trait board's lane: the fourth chrome surface. (PE3b)
//!
//! Same arrangement as [`crate::vitals`] and [`crate::succession`] —
//! [`mesocosm_views::board_root`] diffed into a `ScriptedDom`, Livery styling
//! and laying it out, the paint list lowered and rasterized,
//! [`crate::chrome`] blending it over the frame.
//!
//! # Why a fourth lane rather than the checkpoint widened
//!
//! The checkpoint panel is **four facts, two answers, out**, and a
//! `mesocosm-views` test asserts in so many words that it never mentions a
//! program, a trait, a budget, an epoch, a revision or a founder. Widening it
//! to carry a candidate table would delete that claim and make the individual
//! checkpoint into the editor PE1's stop rule forbids it from becoming. The two
//! surfaces also change on different clocks — a checkpoint is fixed once shown,
//! a board re-reads after every commit — and want different boxes. So: two
//! lanes, and at a lineage checkpoint the board is the one that draws.
//!
//! No text rendering lives here. Words are Livery's, and the sentences are
//! `mesocosm-views`'.
