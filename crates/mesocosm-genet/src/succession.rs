//! The checkpoint lane: the third chrome surface, and the only one that is
//! usually not there.
//!
//! Same arrangement as [`crate::vitals`] — [`mesocosm_views::succession_root`]
//! diffed into a `ScriptedDom`, Livery styling and laying it out, the paint
//! list lowered and rasterized, [`crate::chrome`] blending it over the frame.
//! It differs in two ways only: it sits in the middle of the frame rather than
//! a corner, because the world behind it has stopped; and it is built from the
//! driver's question rather than from the world, because a world can say what
//! is and never that it is waiting.
//!
//! No text rendering lives here. Words are Livery's, and the sentences are
//! `mesocosm-views`'.
