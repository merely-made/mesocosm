//! What a played session leaves behind, and what drives one without a player.
//!
//! A run is a seed, an organism count, admitted content, and an ordered trace;
//! the hash is what two runs compare. The trace file carries these so `--replay` can assert
//! rather than merely re-run, and so the assertion needs no second file.
//!
//! The recorded demo answers its own checkpoints, because a checkpoint holds the
//! world and a recording that ignored one would simply stop advancing. Those
//! answers are ordinary intents, so they sit in the trace beside the moves and
//! the meals and replay with them.
//!
//! # Where an unnamed run writes, and where it does not
//!
//! The trace, the receipt and the capture all default to a **scratch** name
//! under the headed-verify home — [`DEFAULT_STEM`] — and the golden
//! `ps1_played.*` fixture is written only when a path names it. Ruled by Mark
//! on 2026-09-02 and wired on 2026-09-04: the defaults *were* the fixture, so
//! the plainest possible run of this binary overwrote the file the scenario
//! driver checks a replay against, and every landing entry in the dev tools
//! plan had to pass explicit paths to stay out of its way. A discipline
//! somebody keeps is not a property of the program; this is.
