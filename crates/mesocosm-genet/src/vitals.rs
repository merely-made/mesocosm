//! The cambium lane, hosted: the vitals panel over the traced section.
//!
//! Genet does **not** own the window here. The runner diffs
//! [`mesocosm_views::vitals_root`] into a `ScriptedDom`, Livery resolves the
//! sheet and lays the tree out, its paint list lowers through
//! `paint_list_render`, and [`crate::chrome`] rasterizes and blends it over the
//! frame exactly as it does the minimap. The full host inversion — genet
//! owning the window with the game view embedded as an external texture — is a
//! scope decision that stays Mark's, and is not needed for a panel.
//!
//! No text rendering lives here or anywhere in this repo. Words are Livery's.
