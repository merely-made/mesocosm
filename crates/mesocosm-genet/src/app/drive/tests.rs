//! The scenario driver, without a window. (DT4)
//!
//! `Host::frame` advances the world before it touches the device, so a headless
//! pump is the same three calls in the same order minus the drawing — which is
//! what [`pump`] is. Everything the driver decides (what `busy` means, what a
//! snapshot says, whether an assertion holds) is decided off world state and
//! retained DOMs, so none of it needs a GPU to be tested.
