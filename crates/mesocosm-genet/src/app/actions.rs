//! What a scenario's `act` can ask for, and the one route a key takes. (DT4)
//!
//! # The mapping is the host's own key names
//!
//! `act` carries **the same names `--help` documents**, one per key, rather
//! than a second vocabulary of intent names and fields. Two reasons, and the
//! second is the load-bearing one:
//!
//! - It is smaller. `act e` is the E key, `act x` is the X key, and there is
//!   nothing to look up: a scenario reads like the controls list.
//! - It cannot drift. [`Host::press_key`] is the *same* function the window's
//!   keyboard handler calls, so a scripted `act e` goes through
//!   `crate::input::intent_for`, the checkpoint's answers, the board's two
//!   keys, the dev-key split and the queue's backlog cap in exactly the order a
//!   person's keypress does. A mapping that built intents directly would be a
//!   second input policy, quietly agreeing with the first until the day it did
//!   not — and the dev tools plan's stop rules forbid exactly that.
//!
//! An intent name and fields would have bought the ability to script things no
//! key can express (metabolize *that* organism, place matter *there*), and the
//! host does not need them: what DT3's keys act on is the followed critter, and
//! following is scriptable.
//!
//! # And five host-side names for what no key says
//!
//! A script has no eye and no hand, so a handful of things a person does
//! without thinking have no key at all. These are host actions rather than new
//! genet-probe verbs, per the plan's instruction: where the stack lacks a verb,
//! express it through `act` with a host-side name and report the gap.
//!
//! | Name | What it does | Why no key |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `follow <id>` | camera onto one critter | `--follow`'s job; the keys only cycle |
//! | `follow-nearest` | camera onto the nearest living neighbour | a person looks; a script cannot |
//! | `follow-child` | camera onto the last forced birth's offspring | the id is not knowable in advance |
//! | `hunt <steps>` | eat, or hunt, for N ticks | where `--auto-eat` went |
//! | `demo <steps>` | N ticks of the recorded demo script | where `--record-demo` went |
//!
//! # The two pumps run off the clock, and that is the point
//!
//! `--auto-eat` metabolized every N *steps* while wall time drove the ticks, so
//! how much of an enclosure a capture run had eaten depended on the frame rate
//! it was captured at. A scenario asks for ticks and gets exactly those:
//! [`Pump`] calls [`mesocosm_runtime::Runtime::step`] directly, the way DT1's
//! manual step key does. A scripted run is therefore the same run on any
//! machine — which is what lets one assert a hash at the end of it.
//!
//! A scenario that also wants wall time back pairs a pump with DT1's pause
//! (`act p`), so nothing but the pump moves the world.
