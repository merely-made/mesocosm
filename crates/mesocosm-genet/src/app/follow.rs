//! Host-only follow (DT2): which critter the section's slab is centred on.
//!
//! Split out of `app.rs` for the reason [`super::devtime`] was — the file sits
//! at its six-hundred-line ceiling — and it keeps the same discipline.
//! **Nothing here reaches [`mesocosm_runtime::Runtime::queue`]**, so nothing
//! here can enter the trace or move a replay's hash: following changes where
//! the camera looks and nothing else.
//!
//! # Follow is not control
//!
//! [`Host::followed`] answers *whose body the camera is on*; `World::controlled`
//! answers *whose body a key would move*. The two are deliberately separate and
//! the second never moves here: `crate::section::pose_of` still poses the
//! controlled critter at full fidelity and `roster_of` still excludes it, so
//! following somebody else moves the slab's centre over them and leaves the
//! played body exactly where it was.
//!
//! # A followed critter that dies is reported
//!
//! The one thing follow may not do is fail quietly. When the target stops being
//! alive, [`Host::update_follow`] takes the record's own ending
//! ([`mesocosm_core::History::ending`]) and keeps it as a [`Lost`] for the tile
//! to print, then snaps follow back to the controlled critter. The succession
//! lane is untouched: a death of the *controlled* critter is still the
//! driver's checkpoint and behaves exactly as it did.
