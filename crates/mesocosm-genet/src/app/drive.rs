//! The host, driven by a text scenario. (DT4)
//!
//! Mesocosm's replay-and-demo harness used to be entirely its own: a
//! `--replay` cursor, a `--record-demo` script, an `--auto-eat` interval and a
//! one-off `examples/dt3_script.rs`, each a separate way of running the game
//! without a person in front of it. The dev tools plan's fourth principle says
//! that folds toward genet-probe rather than growing, and this is the fold: the
//! host implements [`Automatable`] and [`Driveable`], and
//! [`genet_probe::Scenario`] — the same driver turnstone uses — pumps a text
//! file against it one step per rendered frame.
//!
//! # What each verb means here
//!
//! | Verb | Here |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `act <name>` | one of the host's own documented key names, or one of five host actions — see [`super::actions`] |
//! | `click .class text` | **attributed, not delivered** — see the gap below |
//! | `settle N` | pump N frames |
//! | `wait [cap]` | hold until [`Automatable::busy`] reads quiet |
//! | `assert text <s>` | `s` appears on a chrome lane that is actually on screen |
//! | `assert snap <f> <op> <v>` | a field of [`Host::snapshot`] — the state hash, the tick, the dev-intent count, the assisted label |
//! | `assert event <s>` | `s` appears in what the world answered |
//! | `capture <name>` | the run's own capture path, through [`super::Host::capture_to`] |
//! | `log <words>` | into the run's log |
//!
//! # `busy`, and what it means for this host
//!
//! Busy means **scripted work is still in flight that the next step must not
//! race**: a replay whose cursor has not reached the end of its trace, a demo
//! or a hunt still pumping, or an intent still sitting in the queue.
//!
//! **A checkpoint holding the world with nothing queued is quiet, not busy**,
//! and that is a decision rather than an oversight. A checkpoint is the world
//! stopped, waiting to be answered; nothing about it resolves on its own, so
//! reporting busy would burn the whole `wait` cap and then proceed anyway — a
//! hang dressed as a wait. It is exactly the moment the scenario's next step
//! (`act enter`, `act t`, `act r`) is needed, so `wait` hands control back and
//! the script answers. An answer already in the queue *is* busy, because the
//! hold lifts on the step that reaches it.
//!
//! # Stack gaps found doing this, reported rather than built
//!
//! - **Pointer delivery.** `Automatable` requires `press`/`moved`/`release`,
//!   and `mesocosm-genet` has nowhere to route a window point: DT2 already
//!   found that click-to-select in the section needs picking machinery this
//!   host does not have, and the chrome lanes are rasters composited over the
//!   frame with no hit-test path back into cambium. So the three are
//!   **attributed no-ops**: they record `pointer-unrouted x y` into the event
//!   stream, which an `assert event` can catch, rather than silently swallowing
//!   a click and letting the scenario believe it landed. `click` therefore
//!   resolves a selector correctly and then goes nowhere, which is the honest
//!   state of this host and not a defect in genet-probe.
//! - **No verb for founding a world.** A scenario is pumped inside an app that
//!   already exists, so the seed, the founder count and a trace to replay are
//!   necessarily flags. Expressed as `--seed`, `--replay` and `--scenario`
//!   rather than as scenario lines.
//! - **No loop or repeat verb.** The demo's three thousand steps and a hunt's
//!   standing interval are host actions taking a count (`act demo 3100`,
//!   `act hunt 12`) because the grammar has no way to say "again".
