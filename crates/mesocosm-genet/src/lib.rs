//! Mesocosm's windowed host.
//!
//! Owns the window, the device, and the frame loop. Holds **no game state**:
//! input becomes intents, the shared runtime steps the world at a fixed rate,
//! and the world comes back out to be drawn. If a rule ever appears in this
//! crate, it is in the wrong crate.
//!
//! The loop is the standard one, and the reason it is safe is elsewhere:
//! `mesocosm-runtime` converts however much wall time actually elapsed into
//! whole fixed steps, so a stuttering window cannot change what happens.
//!
//! The main view is the lens brick tracer's side-on terrarium section over the
//! live world (PS1). Camera motion is presentation only and never enters the
//! trace, which is what lets a recorded session replay to the same hash.

//! Five chrome lanes ride the frame, all through [`chrome`]: the painted
//! minimap ([`hud`]), the cambium vitals panel ([`vitals`], landed 2026-08-29),
//! the individual checkpoint ([`succession`], PE1), the trait board
//! ([`review`], PE3b), and the dev lane ([`dev`], DT1). The checkpoint and the
//! board draw only while the driver is holding the world at a question, and
//! never both at once; the dev lane draws only while `--dev` is set. None of
//! them touches the world, so none can reach the trace.
