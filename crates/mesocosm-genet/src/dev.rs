//! The dev lane, hosted. (DT1, DT2)
//!
//! Same arrangement as [`crate::vitals`] and [`crate::succession`]:
//! [`mesocosm_views::dev_root`] diffed into a `ScriptedDom`, Livery resolving
//! the sheet and laying the tree out, the paint list lowered through
//! `paint_list_render`, [`crate::chrome`] rasterizing and blending it over the
//! frame. No text rendering lives here or anywhere in this repo; words are
//! Livery's and the sentences are `mesocosm-views`'.
//!
//! Live only while `--dev` is set — [`crate::app::Host`] gates every call
//! into this module on that flag and never builds a [`Dev`] reading
//! otherwise, so an ordinary build pays for an idle raster and nothing else.
//!
//! # Placement is a workbench tile's, not a hand-rolled corner
//!
//! Ruled 2026-09-02, dev tools plan §4.2: the dev lane's placement is
//! whatever `workbench`'s split-and-tab tree gives, not the fixed-margin
//! `placement()` every other lane in this crate hand-rolls. The tree DT1
//! builds holds exactly one tile, so [`rect_of`] always hands that tile the
//! whole of the reserved dock — but it is the honest walk of the tree's own
//! splits and shares, not a shortcut that happens to agree with one for a
//! single tile: a `Split` divides the dock by each child's fraction exactly
//! as `workbench::TileBranch::fraction` documents it, and only a `Stack`
//! bottoms out in a rect.
//!
//! What is genuinely missing from the stack, found doing this: `workbench`
//! (the `genet` repo, `components/workbench`) is a host-owned tree and
//! reducer only — there is no genet-side *surface* that renders a `TileTree`
//! to pixels, draws its tab strip, or turns a drag into a `TileEvent`. DT1
//! never needs one, because its tree never holds more than the one tile
//! nothing ever drags. A second dev tile (DT2's follow-and-inspect panel,
//! most likely) is what would make the split arithmetic below do real work
//! for the first time; drawing an actual tab strip a player could click, or a
//! divider they could drag, needs that missing surface piece and is out of
//! this phase's reach for exactly that reason — reported here rather than
//! built, per the plan's stop rule against a new stack widget.
//!
//! **DT2 stayed inside the one tile for exactly that reason**, and it is what
//! moved the dock. DT1's dock was the top-left corner, which is 196 pixels tall
//! before it reaches the vitals panel below it; an inspector with a dozen rows
//! does not fit there and covering the vitals panel would not be an
//! improvement. The dock is now the right column under the minimap — the other
//! region no lane claims — and the tile still takes it through [`rect_of`]
//! rather than a hardcoded rectangle. The corner was never a ruling: §4.2 rules
//! that the placement is the tree's, and this is the same tree.
