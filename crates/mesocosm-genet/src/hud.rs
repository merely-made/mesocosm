//! The minimap: a sprigging leaf rasterized by netrender on the game's own
//! device.
//!
//! Route A of the staged host ruling (2026-08-02): the leaf paints `PaintCmd`s,
//! `paint_list_render` lowers them, and [`crate::chrome`] rasterizes and
//! blends. **Painted, not textless** — the guard was lane discipline, not a
//! text ban (views founding plan §6, amended 2026-08-29). This lane draws
//! marks in the scene; words go through cambium, which
//! [`crate::vitals`] is the first consumer of. What the guard still forbids is
//! teaching this lane lettering as a shortcut.
