//! Which way the section looks, and the slab that follows from it. (DC4, Q9)
//!
//! **Presentation only, and measured before it was ruled.** Mark's 2026-09-02
//! ruling on the default creatures plan's ninth open question was *measure
//! before ruling*: a body's segments chain along `+z` and the section then
//! shipped looked along `-z`, so every critter was drawn end-on and the
//! roster's whole part budget landed in one pixel column. This module is the
//! instrument that question asked for — the same tick, rendered three ways.
//! The measurement is on record in the plan's Q9 Findings entry, and Mark
//! ruled on it the same day: **[`CameraMode::Oblique`] is the default**, the
//! only arm that shows a body's part budget and keeps the section's vertical
//! read. All three modes stay, because the sheet they compose is the evidence
//! for the ruling.
//!
//! Nothing here reaches an intent, a snapshot or the state hash; the
//! `--camera` flag is a sibling of `--slab`, and a replay under any of the
//! three lands on the same hash.
//!
//! # Why all three are cheap
//!
//! [`mesocosm_lens::TraceCamera::orthographic_slab`] takes an arbitrary
//! forward and up and orthonormalizes them itself, and the tracer's DDA
//! marches whatever rays it is handed. So an off-axis section costs a
//! different set of three unit vectors and nothing else: no shader change, no
//! second pipeline, no new binding. The expensive option in Q9 is the third
//! one Mark named — the rotatable isometric cube with the interior cut — and
//! that one is *not* built here; the plan's Findings entry says what it would
//! take.
//!
//! # The one thing that had to generalize with the camera
//!
//! The roster's cull window. It used to be an axis-aligned box because the
//! camera was axis-aligned, and left that way it would have picked the wrong
//! critters the moment the camera turned: `across` would have rostered a
//! hundred voxels of `x` it cannot see and none of the `z` it can. So
//! [`SlabWindow`] now carries the camera's own basis and tests against it,
//! which is exact for all three modes and reduces to precisely the old
//! numbers for [`CameraMode::Side`].
