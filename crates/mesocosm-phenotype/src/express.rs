//! Authored development: a typed request in, a typed proposal out. (PD4)
//!
//! The pack door admits *definitions*; this admits *decisions about them*. An
//! author writes one Lua function, the host hands it a frozen picture of a body
//! and its situation, and what comes back is a [`Proposal`] — never a change.
//! The proposal is lowered to the ordinary
//! [`AllocationProposal`](mesocosm_core::AllocationProposal) and offered to the
//! one validator, which accepts or refuses it exactly as it would a hand-drawn
//! or an automatic one.
//!
//! # Lua cannot mutate anything, and that is structural
//!
//! Not a discipline, not a review note — a property of what the runner is able
//! to hand across:
//!
//! - **No host functions.** The runner registers nothing in the globals. There
//!   is no callback into Rust, so there is no Rust value a script could reach
//!   to change. Its whole world is the tables it was given and what
//!   [`Lua::core`](piccolo::Lua::core) provides.
//! - **No I/O in the sandbox.** `Lua::core()` deliberately omits the `io`
//!   library, and piccolo 0.3 has no `os`, `require`, `dofile` or `loadfile` at
//!   all — so there is no network, filesystem, environment or wall clock to
//!   reach.
//! - **No randomness of its own.** `Lua::core()` *does* install `math.random`
//!   and `math.randomseed`, seeded from OS entropy, so [`Runner::load`] deletes
//!   both. Entropy is host-owned, drawn before the call, handed in as plain
//!   integers, and recorded (see [`Entropy`]).
//! - **The Rust side is by value.** The runner takes a `&Request` — a frozen
//!   copy of declared facts — and returns a `Proposal`. It never holds a
//!   `&mut World`, a `&mut BodyPhenotype`, or any handle to one. There is
//!   nothing mutable in this module's public API for a script to be pointed at.
//!
//! What survives all of that is the only power an author has: *saying what the
//! body should express*, and being told no.
//!
//! # The entrypoint
//!
//! ```text
//! function express(request, entropy) -> proposal end
//! ```
//!
//! `request` is a table (see [`Request`]); `entropy` is an array of
//! [`DRAWS`] integers the host drew and wrote down; `proposal` is
//! `{ sites = { { part = <id>, process = "<namespace>:<name>", cells = <n> } } }`.
//!
//! # Refusals name the boundary
//!
//! Plan §4 asks that every refusal say which boundary failed. [`Refused`] is
//! that list at this door — unknown id, invalid part, excessive output,
//! exhausted fuel, and the rest — and the ones the *validator* owns arrive
//! whole, as [`Refused::Validator`], rather than being restated here. There is
//! one developmental authority and this is a proposal source over it.
