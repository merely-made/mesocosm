//! Discovery, admission, and lowering.
//!
//! # All or nothing
//!
//! A pack admits completely or not at all. Half a biology is not a smaller
//! biology, it is a different one: a body that cites a definition the partial
//! admission dropped would resolve `None` on every site it occupies, and a
//! world would run something nobody authored.
//!
//! # Deterministic, and independent of the disk
//!
//! Nothing here depends on directory iteration order. The manifest names every
//! file; files are read in the order it names them, lowered, and then sorted
//! into canonical order by [`Registry::admit`]. The one place a directory is
//! read — the undeclared-file check — sorts its entries before reporting one,
//! so two machines refuse the same pack with the same message.
