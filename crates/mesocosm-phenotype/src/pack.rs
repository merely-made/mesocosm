//! The on-disk schema: exactly what a pack file may say.
//!
//! `deny_unknown_fields` on both records is deliberate and is half of what
//! "malformed schema is refused" means. A typo in a key is not a comment: a
//! definition whose `expresed_by` was silently ignored would admit a process
//! nothing can express, and the world would be a different world for a reason
//! nobody chose. The other half is that every word in a rule-bearing field is
//! a closed set — [`role_of`] and [`seeding_of`] answer `None` rather than
//! guessing.
