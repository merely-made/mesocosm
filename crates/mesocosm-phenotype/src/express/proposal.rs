//! What a script says, and how it becomes something the validator can read.
//! (PD4)
//!
//! # The smallest proposal plan §4 describes
//!
//! *Which admitted process should express on which existing part, at what
//! bounded capacity.* Three fields, and no fourth: not a cost (the host prices
//! the accepted result), not a cell address (the host lays tissue out), not a
//! revision (the host froze one into the request). Everything a script could
//! get wrong that the game would then have to live with is simply not
//! expressible.
//!
//! # Lowering is deterministic, and the script does not choose it
//!
//! A part's requested sites take tissue from the high end of its lattice
//! downward, in the order the script listed them, each run contiguous — the
//! same suffix rule
//! [`Candidate::propose`](mesocosm_core::Candidate) already relies on, and for
//! the same reason: a suffix of the row-major order is a connected region and
//! so is the prefix left behind. What the script did not claim keeps doing what
//! it did. The result is a **complete desired state** for the parts named,
//! which is the only shape the validator accepts.
