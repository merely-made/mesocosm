//! A declared expression fixture: the exact proposal, and the exact draws.
//! (PD4)
//!
//! Plan §4 asks for *exact fixtures for proposal, entropy draws, validation and
//! refusal*. This is the record. It pins both halves deliberately: a script
//! that changes **how many numbers it reads, or in what order** is a different
//! script even when it happens to return the same proposal today, and a fixture
//! that only checked the proposal would let that through.
