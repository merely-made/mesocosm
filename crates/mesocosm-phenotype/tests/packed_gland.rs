//! PD3 parity: the packed gland is PD2's gland. (PD3)
//!
//! The gate asks that the packed definition lower to **the same `ProcessDef`
//! and the same game outcome** as the native proof. Those are two claims and
//! there is a test for each:
//!
//! 1. the definition admitted out of `packs/mesocosm/processes/secrete.json`
//!    is the definition `mesocosm-core` holds — same site requirement, same
//!    seeding, same content address, so every allocation already citing it
//!    resolves against the packed ruleset unchanged;
//! 2. a body driven through the packed reference reaches PD2's four states —
//!    a located, paid-for gland; a charged one; a dry one; and a lost one —
//!    with the same numbers the native proof recorded.
//!
//! And the third claim the world half of the gate makes: a snapshot names the
//! ruleset it ran under, and a restore offered a different one refuses.
