# The General Model (2026-08-06)

**Status: research and founding, 2026-08-06.** The ecological half is a
scheduled change with gates. The fantastical half is a **proposed shape,
not an adoption**: nothing in §6-§9 is scheduled, and F-gates exist to be
argued with. Sibling to the
[place-graph engine plan](2026-08-05_place_graph_engine_plan.md), which
owns world substrate, and the
[mesocosm founding plan](2026-07-30_mesocosm_founding_plan.md), which owns
the epoch loop.

**Implementation status, 2026-08-07 (audit-corrected wording): E0-E4
implementation slices landed and workspace-green; acceptance gates
open.** E0 allometry, E1 anatomy-derived feeding and
predation, E2 graph dispersal, and E4 drive selection are live. E3 has a
reversible far-tier cohort projection plus conservation and promotion
receipts; the authoritative individual-to-cohort storage replacement and
the order-of-magnitude capacity benchmark remain open.

**Wing-level notice.** §5-§9 describe machinery all three vessels would
share (Mesocosm discovers, Paredros embodies, Isometry exploits). Per
`CLAUDE.md`, wing material lives once. Siblings cite this file; they do
not copy it.

## 0. Why one document

Two questions arrived separately and turned out to be one question.

The first was Mark's: **shouldn't the priority be to shape the world and
its conditions so that behaviour just emerges?** The second was whether
the Madingley model, and a fantastical counterpart to it, are the right
lodestars.

They join at a single observation. Madingley's spine is *biomass flowing
between pools via processes, at rates set by traits*. Strip the word
"biomass" and what remains is a **causal grammar**: sources,
transformations, storage, channels, sinks, signals, constraints. Bodies,
ecologies, and fantastical systems can all speak it.

**Corrected 2026-08-07 (review).** The first draft concluded "one model
with settings, and the ecology is its first configuration." That
generalized past the wing's own authority rules: the
[phenotype plan](2026-07-31_phenotype_plan.md) forbids sharing an
evaluator before two sovereign rule systems have independently proven the
same mechanism, and the founding record rules that what vessels share is
world identity and compatible facts, never one live world model. The
correct claim is:

> **One causal grammar, separately proven rule systems, and extraction
> after repetition.**

Mesocosm implements its ecology concretely first. One fantastical
mechanic later proves whether a bounded primitive genuinely repeats;
only then is anything extracted. Configurability survives intact (a
world's metaphysics is which carriers and rules it instantiates), but as
a family of sovereign configurations over a shared grammar, not settings
on one engine.

## 1. Prior-art ledger, verified 2026-08-06

Terminology first, because naming what exists tells us what does not.

| Term | Status | What it actually names |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **General Ecosystem Model (GEM)** | Established | Madingley's category. "General" = one set of ecological concepts applied to any ecosystem, terrestrial or marine, at any resolution. Madingley is described as the first process-based mechanistic GEM. |
| **Speculative evolution** | Established community term (Dougal Dixon) | The creature and ecology half, non-magical. |
| **Computational modeling of religion** | Real academic field | Agent-based modelling of belief, practice, demography. Center for Mind and Culture's Modeling Religion Project; Wildman, *Modeling Religion*. The genuine analogue on the belief side. |
| **Thaumatology** | Real word; GURPS uses it as a book title | The *study of magic systems*. The GURPS volume is explicitly a meta-book of alternative frameworks (spell-based, ceremonial, spirit-mediated, runic, freeform, material). Closest existing English word for the discipline. |
| "magical ecology" | TTRPG/worldbuilding usage, one published supplement | Content-generation advice. No formal semantics. |
| "thaumodynamics", "arcanology" | Hobbyist worldbuilding only | In-fiction disciplines invented per setting. |
| Mauss & Hubert, *A General Theory of Magic* (1902) | Real, literally titled "general theory" | Anthropological theory of magic as total social phenomenon. A theory, not a model class, and argues *against* Frazer's reduction. |

**The finding: the GEM-shaped slot is empty.** No established term names a
general, mechanistic model class for fantastical ecology or metaphysics.
Also absent, and searched for rather than skipped: any academic subfield
for procedural generation of magic systems, and any GDC talk specifically
about simulating supernatural or belief systems.

Per `CLAUDE.md`, **no name is coined here.** Recording the empty slot is
the finding. A naming round with the usual crates.io, game, studio, and
trademark checks happens separately, if ever.

### 1.1 Sources that carry weight

- **Madingley**: Purves et al. 2013; Harfoot et al. 2014, *Emergent Global
  Patterns of Ecosystem Structure and Function from a Mechanistic General
  Ecosystem Model*, PLOS Biology.
- **Effect systems**: Dwarf Fortress syndromes and spheres (wiki, verified).
- **Procedural history**: Grinblat & Bucklew, FDG 2017 PCG Workshop
  (Caves of Qud); Grinblat, "Generating Histories" in *Procedural
  Storytelling in Game Design* (2019).
- **Knowledge propagation**: James Ryan, Talk of the Town / Hennepin;
  "Simulating Character Knowledge Phenomena in Talk of the Town",
  *Game AI Pro 3* (2017). The only worked implementation found of belief
  as a *distorted propagating representation* rather than a fact.
- **Constraint design**: Sanderson's First and Second Laws (primary
  source). Second Law decomposes into three separable levers:
  *limitations* (what it cannot do), *weaknesses* (what it exposes you
  to), *costs* (what it consumes).
- **Historical schemas as structural templates**: Frazer's two laws of
  sympathetic magic; wuxing (five nodes, two directed cycles, plus a
  correspondence join table); humoral theory (a 2-axis product space);
  Paracelsian doctrine of signatures; hermetic correspondences.

### 1.2 The cautionary source

Raph Koster's own account of Ultima Online: the simulated ecology was cut
in beta for **performance and maintainer comprehension**, after being
rewritten by an engineer who did not understand it. What died was the
behavioural half. The static resource data survived and still feeds
crafting today.

Two lessons, both binding on this document:

> **Simulated layers die to performance and to comprehension before they
> die to players.** And **the data half can survive when the dynamics half
> is throttled.**

Which argues for inspectable state (fields, syndromes, currencies) over
opaque dynamics (behaviour engines), and for building every layer so its
state stays legible and attributable even if its dynamics are cut.

---

## 2. Madingley, mechanically

- **Cohorts, not individuals.** A cohort is organisms sharing functional
  group and continuous traits within a cell, carrying three state
  variables: abundance, body mass per individual, reproductive mass. When
  cohort count exceeds a threshold, the nearest pair in trait space merges
  and biomass is conserved across the merge.
- **Autotrophs are stocks, not cohorts.** Deliberately: "individual" is
  ill-defined for a plant, and marine turnover outruns the timestep.
- **Six heterotroph processes per timestep, plus primary production**:
  metabolism, feeding, growth, reproduction, mortality (predation,
  starvation, background, senescence), dispersal (diffusion,
  starvation-driven, currents). **The order in which cohorts act is
  randomised each timestep** (verified against the paper 2026-08-07; an
  earlier draft mis-stated this as process-order randomisation).
- **Categorical traits select qualitative mechanisms** (feeding mode;
  endo/ectotherm); **continuous traits, chiefly body mass, modulate
  rates** alongside environment and functional group, through allometric
  relations, across **10 ug to 150,000 kg** (fourteen orders of
  magnitude; an earlier draft wrote 10 mg).
- **The payoff**: biomass pyramids, trophic structure along productivity
  gradients, latitudinal carnivore ratios, body-mass/density relations,
  all **emergent and unfitted**, from individual-level processes alone.

That last line is the published receipt for "shape the conditions and let
behaviour emerge."

## 3. Where Mesocosm already stands

Checked against the live core and workspace seams, 2026-08-07.

| Madingley process | Mesocosm |
| --- | --- |
| Metabolism | Present. `pay_upkeep`, budget first then body. |
| Autotrophy | Present. Producers fix, crowding shades income. |
| Herbivory | Present. Consumers graze producers in range. |
| Decomposition | Present, and explicit rather than folded into stocks. |
| Growth | Present. `gain_mass`, juvenile stage. |
| Reproduction | Present. Gestation, offspring costs a share of parent mass. |
| Mortality | Present. Starvation, senescence, predation-as-carrion. |
| **Predation** | Present. Feeding mode is read from body symmetry and contractile anatomy; live prey records `MealKind::Predation`. |
| **Dispersal** | Present in the scheduled slice. Near bodies move by integer steps; far bodies move through the place graph or diffuse when exhausted. |

Mesocosm additionally has something Madingley does not: **`Signal`**, an
advertised claim that can be false. Choosing a meal is already a judgment
rather than a lookup.

At founding, the ecological work was **two missing processes and one changed
principle**, not a rewrite. The scheduled slice now supplies those process
seams; the remaining work is receipt depth, especially population-scale far
state.

### 3.1 The changed principle

Madingley's real lesson is not the process list. It is *categorical
minimal, continuous drives rates*. The scheduled slice now expresses
maturity, lifespan, gestation, income, feeding, decay, upkeep, and dispersal
through integer mass-derived functions. `Kingdom` remains a compatibility
reading, but is derived from the body's symmetry; feeding mode also reads
contractile anatomy.

### 3.2 The concrete bug

`upkeep_mg = UPKEEP_MG + biomass_mg / UPKEEP_SHARE` is **linear in mass**.
Real metabolism scales as roughly mass^0.75 (Kleiber). Linear upkeep
over-taxes large bodies at exactly the rate that makes large bodies
unviable, so the world carries a **size ceiling nobody chose**. This is
worth fixing on its own merits, independently of everything else here.

### 3.3 What emergence buys, concretely

Point the existing pieces at each other and roles stop being categories:

- **Feeding is a satisfied process, not an anatomy reading.** The first
  draft said "a body that can take living prey *is* a predator," which
  regressed behind the ProcessDef ruling that capability is read from
  **allocation, anatomy, channels, cost, and environment**. A mouth-shaped
  part establishes nothing by itself: it may lack contraction, digestion,
  control, throughput, or a suitable medium, and two identical plates may
  express armour and light capture. The correct sentence: **ecology
  queries satisfied feeding processes; trophic role is a derived summary
  of realized activity.** The landed E1 derives from anatomy as an
  interim; the PD1b-backed form is the standing target. `Kingdom`'s own
  doc says a lineage may combine roles while each organism stores one
  variant; producer, consumer, and decomposer want to become
  independently realizable strategies, with `Signal` remaining the
  advertised claim.
- **Life history derives from mass.** Maturity, lifespan, gestation,
  dispersal range, feeding rate as power laws. Large becomes slow,
  long-lived, wide-ranging, hungry but efficient, with nothing authored.
- **The `Hunter` dissolves.** Pursuit is what a fast, large-mouthed,
  starving thing does about a reachable meal. The authored `places::Hunter`
  path is retired; only the old epoch pressure fixture still uses "hunter"
  as a test label.

### 3.4 Cohorts are the far tier's natural unit

The place-graph plan's two-tier simulation wants exactly Madingley's
representation: individuals near the focus, **cohorts** at graph distance,
with trait-space merging as demotion and splitting as promotion. The current
slice forms deterministic far-tier cohorts and conserves count, biomass,
energy, and age sums; the individual roster still remains authoritative until
the capacity experiment admits replacing it.

---

## 4. State, as a design questionnaire

**Reframed 2026-08-07 (review).** The first draft called these axes a
currency type and biomass "conserved." Both were wrong: Mesocosm's
simulated biomass is **sourced** (production) and **sunk** (upkeep,
return); a deeper matter model could conserve constituents across
reservoirs, but the stock as simulated does not. And one "currency" type
covering stocks, fields, curses, beliefs, and temperature would be a
universal property bag wearing a nicer name.

The eight axes survive as what they actually are: **a questionnaire every
proposed piece of world state must answer.**

| Axis | Values |
| --- | --- |
| **Conservation** | conserved; sourced (enters from outside); sunk (leaves); both |
| **Transfer cost** | full (giver loses what receiver gains); partial (conversion loss); none (copying) |
| **Locus** | entity; place; edge (kinship, provenance, contact); global |
| **Autonomous change** | persists; decays; regenerates; oscillates |
| **Rivalry** | rival; non-rival |
| **Transmutability** | which other currencies, at what loss |
| **Flow constraint** | which edges permit flow: trophic, contact, sight, descent, provenance |
| **Observability** | visible; inferable; hidden |

Worked points:

- **Biomass**: conserved, full-cost transfer, entity-located, decaying via
  upkeep, rival, weakly transmutable, flows along trophic and contact
  edges, partly observable through size. *The ecology is this point.*
- **A curse**: non-rival, no-cost transfer, edge-located along provenance
  or descent, persistent, hidden until it fires.
- **Ambient power**: sourced, place-located, regenerating, rival,
  observable, flows by proximity.

**Not every combination is coherent**, which is DF's spheres lesson
applied here: any generator over this space needs an **exclusion
relation**, the same way a deity may not hold precluded spheres.

### 4.1 Typed state carriers (2026-08-07)

Answers to the questionnaire sort into a small set of carrier types, and
they stay typed rather than unifying:

| Carrier | What it is | Worked example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **quantity** | conserved or sourced stock on an entity | biomass, energy |
| **field** | place-indexed intensity | ambient power, temperature |
| **condition** | attached state with triggers and duration | a curse, a disease |
| **relation mark** | state on a provenance, descent, contact, or trust edge | contagion, a debt |
| **claim** | observer-relative information that may be false | belief, `Signal` |

An effect application may target any carrier, but **effects propose typed
state changes**; they do not write into a universal currency.

**Observability is a relation, not an axis.** A carrier may hold an
*emission profile* (a field that glows, venom that smells, `Signal`'s
advertised claim); whether anyone observes it depends on the observer's
senses, instruments, position, and history. The eighth axis of the
questionnaire asks about emission; observation lives in the epistemic
loop (S8).

---

## 5. One effect system, four channels

Dwarf Fortress's syndromes are the strongest single mechanism found:
alcohol, snake venom, plague, vampirism, mummy curses, and werebeast
infection are *the same object*, applied through typed channels (contact,
ingested, inhaled, injected), carrying effect sets. Even lycanthropy's
supernatural part is a **trigger predicate over world state**, not a
special case.

The rule this implies, and it is the don't-duplicate ruling again:

> **Do not build a magic-effect type.** Build one effect-application
> envelope with typed channels, and let disease, venom, weather,
> blessing, and curse all emit it. **Effects propose typed state
> changes** against the S4.1 carriers; a world with more carriers than
> biomass gets a richer effect space for free, without a universal
> property bag.

---

## 6. Derivation rules (proposed)

How generated bodies and places acquire fantastical properties without
anyone authoring them. All three have historical schemas behind them and,
usefully, existing hooks here.

- **Signatures** (Paracelsus): form indicates function. A rule for reading
  properties *off* a generated morphology. Hook: the axial generator.
- **Similarity** (Frazer's first law): like produces like. Formally, a
  distance metric over trait vectors. Hook: recipes and somas are already
  trait vectors.
- **Contagion** (Frazer's second law): things once in contact continue to
  act at a distance. Formally, an edge in a provenance graph. Hook:
  **every incorporated part already carries `Provenance`.**

The alignment is lucky rather than clever, and it means sympathetic magic
is nearly free here.

### 6.1 Kleptoplasty past biology

The wing's acquisition metaphor already reaches: kleptoplasty is keeping
working machinery from what you eat. Extending it past biological traits
needs **no new intent**; metabolize stays the one verb.

It needs **criteria**, which is Sanderson's Second Law made mechanical:

- a part structurally capable of hosting the property (capability, not
  inventory);
- a source in a state that releases it;
- finite capacity, so acquisition trades against acquisition.

This is `ProcessDef` and phenotype work, not new machinery.

### 6.2 The skeleton: identity, facts, derivation, transition, projection (2026-08-07; revised in review)

The entity-model question resolves into **five** layers. The prompt that
named the derivation layer was
[PolyCSS](https://github.com/LayoutitStudio/polycss), a CSS 3D engine
rendering VOX/glTF meshes as real DOM elements, each individually
addressable and styled by rules. Its world-lane technique does not
transfer (per-polygon DOM at simulation scale is cardinality death). Its
architecture names one layer; the review caught that four layers describe
a *read pipeline*, while a simulation additionally needs **transition**,
which the wing already owns and the first draft failed to list.

| Layer | What it is | Already standing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Identity** | Stable ids | `OrganismId`, `PartId`, `PlaceId`; chartulary Container platform-side |
| **Facts** | Facets as plain serialized state: mass, traits, carriers. Ordered, hashed, replayable | the core |
| **Derivation** | Rules computing rates, conditions, and affordances from facts | grade blocks; E0 allometry; §6 rules; V2's dependency digests as the invalidation |
| **Transition** | Intent and process resolution: time, choices, conflicts, costs, refusal, causal records. Events yield new facts | `Intent`/`Outcome`, `act.rs`, the ecology step, `History`, replay hashes |
| **Projection** | Per-vessel lenses reading computed values, every emitted element carrying source identity | genet-probe doctrine; `BodyLensProjection` sidecars |

PolyCSS needs no transition layer because CSS describes presentation.
Mesocosm does; it is where the game lives.

The correspondence that makes "derivation" a *styling* layer, closing a
ruling made earlier ("the soul question is a styling matter"):

- signatures and similarity are **selectors over trait vectors**;
- the cascade's inputs, corrected 2026-08-07 (kingdom was circular once
  kingdom became derived): **world law, environment, developmental
  program, phenotype allocation and anatomy, current condition**;
- allometric rates, derived feeding modes, and fantastical properties are
  **computed values**;
- the grade is literally the stylesheet's visual half;
- and each derived property **declares its combinator**: replace, add,
  multiply, clamp, require, or prohibit. A universal winning-declaration
  rule is too weak for biological flow.

Prior art the stack already owns: **livery**, whose enumerable
TOML-property-database discipline is the tamed version of this. The
binding constraint comes from §1.2 and from CSS's own failure mode
(specificity wars): the cascade stays small, strictly ordered, and
attributable. "Why is this critter fast" must answer with a rule chain.

On ECS, reworded after review (the first draft made a category mistake
by opposing them): **ECS is a storage and iteration technique; this
skeleton is a semantic model. ECS is not the domain ontology, and storage
may become data-oriented without changing authority.** Nothing here rules
a data-oriented layout in or out.

Two adjacencies recorded while here: for **Isometry**, PolyCSS is
near-literal prior art (Foundry-class scenes as identity-bearing DOM
elements styled by rules, with a VOX import path rhyming with the bake
pipeline). And the **sprite-stacking deferral has expired**: it was
parked pending a pulled-back camera, which Mesocosm now has (place-graph
plan §0.4). *Correction 2026-08-07: an earlier line called PolyCSS
"structurally sprite stacking"; it is not. PolyCSS meshes VOX into
visible polygon faces placed as DOM leaves; sprite stacking layers
parallel image slices. The reopening stands on the camera ruling alone.*

---

## 7. Composition grammar (proposed)

Ars Magica's formulation is the canonical generative magic grammar: 5
Techniques x 10 Forms, plus requisites, plus per-combination magnitude
guidelines that let any point be *priced* without being authored.

The adaptation, sharper than adopting it whole:

> **Fix the Technique axis; generate the Form axis from the world's own
> ontology.** Create, perceive, transform, control, destroy are near
> universal verbs over anything. Forms should come from what the world
> actually contains: its materials, its kingdoms, its currencies.

Technique x Form is then a matrix, and per the precluded-pairs rule **a
given world fills only some cells**. Which cells exist is that world's
magical character. A closed-form cost function over the parameter vector
(Morrowind's spellmaker is the worked example; Angband's power budget is
the learned-distribution variant) keeps a generated space balanced without
hand tuning.

---

## 8. Discovery as the delivery vehicle (proposed)

If the laws differ per world, **learning them is the content**. NetHack
shuffles appearance-to-identity per game and deliberately supplies more
appearances than items, so elimination stays imperfect. Morrowind's
alchemy hides most ingredient effects and combines by intersection.
Ultima Ratio Regum makes religious identity *inferable from observable
behaviour* rather than readable from a panel.

A hidden effect vector is not yet discovery (review, 2026-08-07). The
loop that makes it one:

```text
world truth
  -> exposure or signal (the carrier's emission profile)
  -> observation (observer's senses, instruments, position)
  -> remembered claim or hypothesis
  -> experiment or consequential choice
  -> confirmation, revision, or deception
```

`Signal` is the landed seed: advertised appearance already disagrees with
actual venom or trophic behaviour, so the claim/truth split exists. F3
builds the rest of the loop on that split.

**Open question the plan must eventually answer: who owns a discovery?**
The current animula, the biological lineage, the world record, shared
players, or a combination. Without a locus, every world's generated laws
are rediscovered from nothing each run and no culture of knowledge
accumulates. `tulpa` (the retold subset) is the wing's existing vocabulary
for exactly this kind of memory.

This distributes across the wing without any vessel converting anything:
**Mesocosm discovers, Paredros embodies** (transformations, pacts, curses
as syndromes), **Isometry exploits** (auras and fields as tactical
terrain).

The cheapest first version is worth building before anything ambitious: a
small fixed-width effect vector per organism, combination by intersection.
It turns the existing procedural ecology into a magic-materials economy at
nearly no cost.

---

## 9. Fields (proposed)

The most implementable "magic as simulated quantity" model found is,
unexpectedly, Genshin's elemental gauge theory: application in gauge
units, an aura tax on creation, linear decay inversely proportional to
base duration, consumption on reaction, per-source internal cooldowns. It
is deterministic and integer-friendly, which matters here more than it
matters there. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is the same idea expressed
spatially, as persistent surface state with combination rules.

For a place graph over voxel ground the natural form is a **small vector
of channels per place**, with units, decay rate, and reactions, read by
spawn rules, terrain, and the ecology's mortality terms. Vintage Story's
temporal stability and Black & White's belief-generated influence radius
are the same shape at world scale.

Breath of the Wild supplies the law that keeps such a table from
exploding: elements act on materials, materials do not act on materials.
The asymmetry is what makes a small rule set multiply rather than square.

---

## 10. Gates

### Ecological, scheduled

**E0. Allometry, and the size ceiling.** `[implemented 2026-08-07]` Replace flat rate constants with
mass-derived rates; fix linear upkeep to a ^0.75-shaped law in integer
arithmetic.
**Done when:** a world sustains bodies across at least three orders of
magnitude of mass; maturity, lifespan, gestation, and feeding rate all
vary with mass; existing ecology receipts are re-greened rather than
deleted; no rate constant remains that should have been a function of mass.

**E1. Predation, and feeding mode from anatomy.** `[implemented 2026-08-07]` Consumers may take
living consumers. `Kingdom` becomes a derived reading of anatomy rather
than a genesis assignment.
**Done when:** a lineage whose bodies acquire the relevant parts begins
taking live prey with nothing in the code naming it a predator; trophic
levels are countable in a run; and the reckoning can distinguish predation
from scavenging (it already can, by event order).

**E2. Dispersal.** `[implemented 2026-08-07, epoch receipt open]` Movement as a far-tier process: diffusion, plus
starvation-driven migration.
**Done when:** populations track productivity across the place graph over
an epoch, and a locally exhausted place is left rather than starved in.

**E3. Cohorts.** `[conservation slice implemented 2026-08-07, capacity gate open]` Far-tier state becomes cohorts with trait-space merging;
near tier stays individual. Promotion and demotion are cohort split and
merge.
**Done when:** biomass is conserved across every merge and split; far-tier
outcomes stay within existing receipts; and the population the far tier
can carry rises by an order of magnitude.

Current receipt: deterministic cohort formation, exact scalar split/merge
conservation, and promotion/demotion counts. Persistent far-tier storage and
the 10x capacity measurement are not yet claimed.

**E4. Drives replace the `Hunter`.** `[implemented 2026-08-07]` Behaviour selection scores reachable
affordances against need and body. The FSM demotes to a probe (see
place-graph plan G3) and leaves the tree.
**Done when:** the chase receipt still passes with no type named `Hunter`
in the path; a slow armoured starving body does something *different* from
a fast large-mouthed one under identical conditions; and a predator that
picks badly starves.

### Acceptance gates, open (review, 2026-08-07; renamed by audit the same day)

**The accurate status is: implementation slices landed; acceptance
gates open.** The first version of this section called these "follow-up
receipts," which the audit correctly flagged as hiding open gates. E1
still uses interim anatomy categories pending PD1b; E2 lacks its epoch
receipt; E3 retains the individual roster as authority and lacks the
capacity proof; E4 selects feeding targets, not yet hunt, migrate,
avoid, graze, and rest through one selector. Each gate below is OPEN
until its condition holds:

- **E0**: allometry becomes a configurable *baseline* modified by active
  tissue/process allocation, metabolic mode, and environment; and every
  derived rate must produce a **derivation trace** on demand, not only
  the right number.
- **E1**: the PD1b-backed form (satisfied feeding processes; trophic
  labels as projections of realized activity) replaces the interim
  anatomy reading; `Kingdom` decomposes into independently realizable
  strategies.
- **E2**: matter, population, and causal movement are **recorded across
  place boundaries**, so migration is attributable, not just simulated.
- **E3**: cohorts inherit the phenotype plan's contract, not Madingley's
  identity-free one: lineage and count; mass and energy; developmental
  distribution; causal seed; **exact refusal to aggregate named, played,
  injured, or chronicled subjects**; deterministic materialization
  without rerolling. Before claiming scale: define **sufficient
  statistics per process** (age structure, reproductive reserves,
  process-expression distribution, lineage contribution, carriers,
  seeds), then a **paired near/far equivalence scenario**. Biomass
  conservation alone is not the receipt.
- **E4**: the done-condition strengthens from "nothing named `Hunter`"
  to **"the same decision machinery produces hunting, migration,
  avoidance, grazing, and rest from different bodies and needs."**

### Fantastical, proposed only

**Not scheduled. No adoption decision. Listed so the shape can be argued
with.**

Reordered 2026-08-07 (review): **the proof precedes the abstraction.**
The first draft's F0 was a registry, which is declaring the portable
profile in advance; the sequence now follows the evaluator rule.

- **F0. One fantastical vertical slice.** One unusual carrier state, one
  cost, one application route, one discoverable consequence, implemented
  concretely inside Mesocosm's own rules. No registry, no shared type.
  **Direction ruled 2026-08-07 (Mark): impossible ecology, not
  spellcasting.** Candidates in the founding record's wording: an
  organism that metabolizes remembered events; migration following
  kinship rather than distance; a predator that consumes names or
  affinities; a body incorporating architectural material; a place that
  develops organs. Each is a perturbation of continuity, which is the
  wing's question wearing the fantastical layer.
- **F1. Effect envelope, extracted.** Only if the F0 slice and an
  ecological effect (venom is the standing candidate) genuinely repeat
  the same application shape does the §5 envelope get extracted.
- **F2. Derivation.** §6: signatures, similarity, contagion, over existing
  trait vectors and provenance edges. Kleptoplasty criteria.
- **F3. Discovery.** §8's epistemic loop on `Signal`'s claim/truth split,
  cheapest version first, with the ownership locus decided.
- **F4. Fields.** §9, per place, integer.
- **F5. Grammar.** §7, only after F0-F2 exist to generate Forms *from*.
  The fixed Technique axis is a **world profile, not engine law**; and a
  closed-form cost function prices effects but cannot establish balance
  without scenario sampling.
- **Registry, if ever**: follows the second working state family, never
  precedes it.

---

## 11. Stop rules

- **No second engine.** The fantastical layer is carriers, effects, and
  derivation rules over the existing machinery. If it grows its own
  simulation loop, it has become the thing the anti-Spore law forbids.
- **No shared evaluator before two sovereign proofs** (phenotype plan's
  rule, which the first draft violated in spirit). Common grammar,
  sovereign rule systems, extraction after repetition. A registry never
  precedes the second working state family.
- **State legible, dynamics throttleable** (§1.2). Every layer must leave
  inspectable, attributable state behind if its dynamics get cut.
- **No name coined without a naming round.** §1's empty slot is a finding,
  not an invitation.
- **Do not model a plan on an unshipped system.** Dwarf Fortress's full
  procedural magic does not ship; spheres, secrets, syndromes, and
  primordial remnants do. Cite what exists.
- **Sample constraints, not powers.** Sanderson's Second Law: a generator
  over powers produces noise, a generator over limitations, weaknesses,
  and costs produces character.
- **Generated rules must be discoverable** or generation has bought
  nothing a content pack would not have.
- Do not let effects, fields, or currencies become world truth in place of
  the integer authority. They are state *in* the world, not a second
  authority over it.

## Findings

- **2026-08-06:** the GEM-shaped slot for a general model class of
  fantastical ecology is **empty** (§1), verified rather than assumed.
  Adjacent named things exist: GEM, speculative evolution, computational
  modeling of religion, thaumatology.
- **2026-08-06:** Mesocosm's ecology already implements six of Madingley's
  eight process slots (§3). The gap is predation and dispersal.
- **2026-08-06:** `upkeep_mg` is linear in body mass where allometry says
  ^0.75, imposing an unchosen size ceiling (§3.2).
- **2026-08-06:** the wing already carries hooks for all three classical
  derivation rules: trait vectors for similarity, morphology for
  signatures, and `Provenance` edges for contagion (§6).
- **2026-08-07:** the entity skeleton is four layers, not an ECS:
  identity, facts, derivation-as-cascade, projection-with-identity
  (§6.2). PolyCSS supplied the naming prompt; livery supplies the tamed
  prior art; sprite stacking's pulled-back-camera deferral has expired.
- **2026-08-07, review pass (accepted nearly whole):** the plan's two
  load-bearing corrections are (1) "one model with settings" replaced by
  **one causal grammar, sovereign evaluators, extraction after
  repetition** (§0), and (2) the skeleton gaining its **transition**
  layer (§6.2), without which it described a simulator schema and not a
  game. Also accepted: typed state carriers over a currency type (§4.1),
  effects *propose* typed changes (§5), feeding as satisfied processes
  with trophic role as a summary of realized activity (§3.3), cascade
  inputs de-circularized with declared combinators (§6.2), the cohort
  lineage contract and sufficient statistics (gates), the epistemic loop
  and the discovery-ownership question (§8), and per-gate follow-up
  receipts. Verified against the paper: Madingley spans **10 µg**, and
  randomizes **cohort order**, both corrected. One nuance retained
  rather than conceded: carriers keep an *emission profile*;
  observability is the relation between that profile and an observer,
  which is `Signal`'s existing split.

### Verification debts

Carried honestly from the research sweep, to be settled before anything
in §6-§9 is built on the details:

- The Caves of Qud state-machine-plus-replacement-grammar description and
  the "rationalise cause and effect after the fact" framing come from
  search summaries and paper metadata; the FDG 2017 PDF itself was not
  extracted. Re-verify directly.
- **Dominions' province-level belief propagation was not verified** and
  looks like one of the stronger missing examples. Worth a dedicated look.
- Spore's part-capability property claim is forum-sourced only.
- Sanderson's Third Law was not read at the primary source.
- Bay 12 dev pages were only partially captured verbatim.
- Not investigated for budget: Populous, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup's
  schools, Niche, Cataclysm: DDA's Magiclysm spell schema, Potion Craft's
  navigable 2D effect space.

## Progress

- **2026-08-06:** founded. Ecological half scheduled as E0-E4; fantastical
  half proposed as F0-F5 pending a ruling. Prior-art ledger and
  verification debts recorded. Research sweep covered ~20 games, the
  design-theory literature, and historical schemas; the Ultima Online
  postmortem supplied the binding caution.
- **2026-08-07:** §6.2 added: the four-layer skeleton and the
  styling-as-derivation correspondence, from the PolyCSS reading session.
- **2026-08-07:** E0-E4 implementation slice landed. Integer allometry,
  body-derived feeding and predation, graph dispersal, far-tier cohort
  conservation, and anatomy-driven drives are covered by core receipts;
  `places::Hunter` was retired. The full offline workspace test suite is
  green. E3's authoritative far-tier storage and 10x capacity gate remain
  open by design.
- **2026-08-07:** review pass folded in: grammar-not-model, transition
  layer, typed carriers, satisfied-process feeding, cohort contract,
  epistemic loop, F-gates reordered proof-first, two Madingley facts
  re-verified at the source.
