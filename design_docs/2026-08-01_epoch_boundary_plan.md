# The epoch boundary: significance, speciation, and what youth costs

**Status: partially built, refreshed 2026-08-31.** The world record, causal
event log, species tree, places, reckoning, and player speciation are built.
Shared lineage adaptation, goals, NPC speciation, life-stage plasticity, and
the played boundary remain design or unwired. The 2026-08-31 reproduction
direction is recorded in section 0; earlier rulings are Mark's from the
dialogue through 2026-08-03 and are marked where the reasoning is mine.

This owns what happens *between* epochs: how a run is judged, how a lineage
splits, what a player may aim at, and why a young critter is different from an
old one. The [phenotype plan](2026-07-31_phenotype_plan.md) owns bodies and
capability. The [process plan](2026-08-01_processdef_plan.md) owns the process
vocabulary. The [founding plan](2026-07-30_mesocosm_founding_plan.md) owns the
epoch loop's turn structure, which this sits on top of.

---

## 0. Reproduction and the boundary are different checkpoints

**Ruled direction, Mark, 2026-08-31:** reproduction is a micro-checkpoint at
the scale of an individual critter. This boundary remains the checkpoint at
the scale of the lineage and its ecology.

The existing breeding pass already pays for and records a filial body. Its
played work is to make descent inspectable and let a recorded control choice
continue through a descendant. It does not open the full lineage editor or
revise the shared developmental program. This boundary reviews the epoch,
weighs evidence and world readings, and commits a program revision that future
descendants may realize. It is not silently triggered by every birth.

The exact reproduction choice and epoch-ending rule remain open. The
[playable ecology plan](2026-08-31_playable_ecology_plan.md) owns their
integration order and full proof; this plan continues to own what the lineage
boundary means once opened.

## 1. The finding that makes this urgent

**Speciation does not exist.** Verified 2026-08-01 in
`crates/mesocosm-core/src/organism/ecology.rs`: reproduction is
`species: parent.species`, and no `SpeciesId` is ever assigned outside world
seeding. Lineages never split. No new species is ever born in a Mesocosm world.

Three things quietly assume otherwise: the complexity frontier (which gates
switching *between* lineages), multiple-lineage play, and any notion of
distance between two creatures' ancestries. The founding plan's open question 2
named speciation, hybridisation, and drift as three tangled mechanisms needing
separate rules. None are built, and this plan rules the first.

---

## 2. Speciation is an act, not a threshold

**Ruled by Mark.** A lineage splits when something *happens*, not when a
similarity metric crosses a line.

- **For the player: naming.** You fork a line and name it. That is the act.
- **For everything else: a significant event.** An unplayed lineage splits when
  it does something the world has not seen.

Note what this rhymes with, because it is the same rule one level up: **a borg
is a named critter.** Naming promotes an individual out of being a statistic;
naming promotes a line out of being a variation. One mechanic, two scales.

The alternative most prior art uses is a divergence threshold: Thrive
auto-speciates when a population's traits drift far enough. That produces
species nobody noticed being born. Dwarf Fortress never speciates at all and its
creature types are eternal. An act-based rule gives the player a moment, gives
the world a reason, and gives both a record of *why* this line exists.

### Speciation pays

**Ruled by Mark.** A significant event is not only a trigger, it is a reward,
and subsequent ones should pay more. The ladder, roughly:

- a boon to the lineage you are currently running;
- the right to fork, name the new line, and claim an ability or upgrade that
  distinguishes it;
- and more at the top, unspecified for now.

The important structural property is that **the reward and the split are the
same event**. A player is not choosing between "take the prize" and "found a
species"; founding one *is* the prize, and it costs the run nothing except
that the new line is now a thing you can be held to.

### Shared lineage authorship

**Ruled by Mark.** Two players inhabiting the same biological lineage share a
parent lineage revision, not one mutable lineage document. Every committed
adaptation creates an immutable child revision:

- if both players agree to the proposed developmental program, they adopt the
  same child as the line's shared continuation;
- if one player proposes a program and the other does not adopt it, the proposer
  follows a child branch while the other remains on the prior continuation;
- neither result edits the parent or field-merges the proposals.

**Ruled by Mark, 2026-08-03:** agreement covers the heritable developmental
program, not the literal allocation mosaic shown in the editor. The editor's
body is a founder preview under declared conditions. Descendants may realize
that shared program differently when their materials, world, injury, or
plasticity differ.

A revision is not automatically a species. Ordinary agreed adaptation may
advance one line without naming a new one. A divergent child is a lineage
branch; the naming and significance rules above decide when that branch is
claimed as a distinct species.

This is **adopt or branch**, not a CRDT. Concurrent developmental proposals may
both be valid descendants of the same parent, but their preview cells are not
merged into a third program by a generic conflict resolver. The game core does
not need a `Player` concept to enforce this: it receives a parent revision,
validated adaptation proposals, and explicit adoptions, then records the
resulting child revision or revisions.

---

## 3. Significance is abnormality against the world's record

**Ruled by Mark.** Significance is judged **retrospectively, at the end of an
epoch, relative to what that world has already seen.** Not against a difficulty
table, not against an authored list of achievements. Against the record.

Scoring must therefore happen at the epoch boundary, because the boundary is
already where you form or fork a critter, and the score is what you form it
with.

### The axes

Mark's list, recorded as given:

| Axis | Question |
| ---- | -------- |
| categorical | *what* was done |
| locality | *where*, and how confined |
| magnitude | worldwide, regional, or local |
| harmony | how much of it was cooperative |
| domination | how much of it was at somebody's expense |
| exploration | how much of the world it touched |
| biomass | percentage gained or lost, and by whom |

Harmony and domination sitting beside each other is the interesting part: they
are not opposite ends of one axis, so a run can score high on both. That is a
lineage that made itself indispensable and dangerous at once, which is a real
ecological posture and not a contradiction.

### Two consequences worth naming, and they are mine rather than Mark's

**The world gets harder to impress, and nobody has to author that.** If
significance is abnormality against the record, then the more a world has seen,
the less any given act stands out. That is a difficulty curve for free, and it
is why an old world should feel different from a young one rather than merely
having more stuff in it.

**Which gives the storyteller a much better brief than "make things happen."**
A world that has seen everything has no significance left to offer, so the
storyteller's actual job is **to keep significance achievable** by opening
possibility the world did not have before. Oxygenation permits metabolisms that
were impossible; a glaciation makes cold-tolerance newly remarkable. Pressure is
not there to hurt the player, it is there to make the record incomplete again.

That reframing also decides a question the founding plan left open: prefer
**endogenous** transitions, because they are the world making its own record
incomplete. Exogenous disturbance is the tool for when it stops doing so.

---

## 4. Goals are the half you can aim at

**Ruled by Mark.** Between epochs, the player picks from roughly five randomly
generated goals. Each is a **guaranteed special event, verified and rated
against the world record** — so a goal might be to do something no species on
that planet has managed, chosen because your lineage is suited to stretch for
it.

### The tension this creates is deliberate

Retroactive abnormality cannot be aimed at, by construction: you find out what
was remarkable after you did it. Selected goals can be aimed at, by
construction: that is what selecting one means.

These pull opposite ways and **both should stay**. They are two reward channels
with different characters: one rewards discovery and cannot be farmed, the
other rewards intention and can be planned around. A future maintainer will be
tempted to collapse them into one, and this section exists to say do not.

### What "verified" costs

A generator that guarantees a goal is achievable, novel against the record, and
suited to the current lineage is performing a search over world state, not
drawing from a table. That is the expensive part of this plan and it wants
bounding before it is built: a goal that turns out to be impossible is worse
than no goal at all, and a goal that is trivially achievable is worse than
either.

---

## 5. Temperament: plasticity is a life stage, and youth pays for it

**Ruled by Mark**, resolving a question I had posed as either/or. Creatures
change most at the beginning and keep changing throughout, so temperament is
neither fixed at imprinting nor uniformly fluid. It is a **life-stage
conditional: more ability to develop, at the cost of the debuffs and
vulnerabilities of youth.**

That is a real trade rather than a curve someone tuned. A juvenile is malleable
and weak; a mature creature is capable and increasingly set. Which means:

- **Plasticity is a resource that depletes**, and spending an epoch young is
  spending capability to buy change.
- **It gives the life stages mechanical teeth** they did not have. `Stage` is
  currently `Juvenile | Mature | Carrion | Spent` and juvenile means little
  beyond not yet reproducing.
- **It interacts with population-as-lives.** Choosing to inhabit a juvenile is
  choosing a fragile body that can still become something; choosing a mature one
  is choosing a capable body that mostly cannot.

Temperament itself stays as ruled on 2026-08-01: **biographical, formed from a
heritable substrate, shaped by environment.** Genetics give you the gland; the
gland does not give you the temper; what happened to you, given that gland,
does. It is therefore a fold over substrate and history, exactly as capability
is a fold over anatomy, and it belongs on the borg layer rather than the
biological one.

---

## 6. Four foundations, now built

All four were verified absent on 2026-08-01 and landed by 2026-08-02.

| Missing | Needed by | Note |
| ------- | --------- | ---- |
| ~~An event log~~ | significance, the world record, world events | **Built 2026-08-02** as `mesocosm-core::history`, on codicil's causal log. |
| ~~A species tree~~ | speciation, ancestral distance | **Built 2026-08-02** as `mesocosm-core::species`. Ancestral distance is computable. |
| ~~A world record~~ | abnormality, goal verification | **Built 2026-08-01** as `WorldRecord`. Not an index over the log; a handful of integers beside it. |
| ~~A place graph~~ | locality and magnitude | **Built 2026-08-02** as `mesocosm-core::places`. All four are now in. |

Two of these have homes already suggested elsewhere. **The event log's growth
problem is what tulpa was invented for**: codicil holds everything, tulpa holds
the retold subset, and "significant world events" and "what memory keeps" turn
out to be one selector at two scales. And **the place graph is the same
place-graph granularity the wing already uses for shared space**, so locality
scoring and cross-vessel space want the same structure.

In-world biological descent is explicitly **not** fili, which is world-lineage
across forks and grafts. Its local home is now `mesocosm-core::species`, beside
rather than on the platform's lineage organs.

---

## 9. The world record, and why mergeability picked its shape

**Built 2026-08-01** in `mesocosm-core::record`, resolving open question 1.

A record is a `BTreeMap<(Feat, Scale), Mark>`: six feats, three scales, and a
`Mark` holding a high-water integer plus the species standing at it. Asking
whether something is unprecedented is one comparison.

### The requirement that chose it was mergeability, not size

Mark raised joining the records of merged worlds and called it silly. It is the
opposite: it is the constraint that rules out every heavier option, and the one
that makes this shape correct rather than merely cheap.

Joining two records takes the higher mark per axis, and that operation is
**commutative, associative, and idempotent**. Those three make it a
join-semilattice, so peers can hand each other records in any order, twice,
interleaved, and converge. **No coordination and no merge protocol.** All three
laws have a test, because they are the load-bearing claim.

Compare what was rejected on exactly that axis. A full-text index can be merged
but relevance across a combined corpus stops meaning the same thing. A vector
index merges trivially by concatenation, but only if both worlds embedded with
the **same model**, which is the ruleset-binding problem wearing a hat: two
worlds that recorded their histories differently could never combine them.

This is also the single place the wing's guidance actually calls for a
conflict-free type. The standing rule is to introduce one only where a domain
proves it needs mergeable concurrent values. This domain proves it, and it is
the trivial case, so mergeability arrives for free rather than as a framework.

### Thresholds forget; holders are retold

**Ruled by Mark.** A pure maximum forgets *who*, so beating a record would erase
the name of whoever held it, which is the fact loss that makes a history feel
fake.

A `Mark` therefore keeps both: the threshold as a maximum, and the holders of
*that* threshold as a set. Ties union, a higher mark replaces, and the set stays
small on its own with no arbitrary cap. Remembering every past holder forever is
the unbounded version and it is deliberately **not** this type's problem: that is
the tulpa selector, which is codicil holding everything and tulpa holding what is
retold. Same rule, third scale.

### Two questions, two structures

Abnormality is a **lookup**: has anyone reached this. That is `WorldRecord`.

Significance in the fuller sense is a **traversal**: what later depended on
this. That is `codicil`'s causal graph, upgraded the same day so a log can
answer it. Keeping them apart keeps the record a handful of integers instead of
an index that has to serve both.

### What is not built

`note` exists and nothing calls it. Wiring the epoch boundary to score a run and
write its marks waits on the event log, on places for `Scale` to mean anything,
and on speciation. The record is the piece those three will need, built first
because it was the piece whose *shape* was in question.
---

## 10. The past, and why it lives beside the world

**Built 2026-08-02** in `mesocosm-core::history`, on the codicil upgrade of the
day before.

A `History` is a `Codicil<Event>` plus one `Seq` per organism. That single map
is the whole causal apparatus: every event cites **the last event about each
subject it touches**, so a creature's events form its line, and an event
touching two creatures joins theirs. Feeding is therefore the operation that
makes this a graph rather than a bundle of chains, which is exactly right,
because eating somebody is the moment two independent histories stop being
independent.

### It is beside the world, not in it

History is **derivable**: a seed plus ordered intents reproduces it exactly,
and there is a test asserting two identical runs produce identical pasts. So
keeping it in the snapshot would grow whole-state capture without bound and
cost the cheap memcpy the wing's rollback thinking depends on, in exchange for
nothing that could not be recomputed.

The world therefore buffers **one tick** of events and a caller drains them.
Two tests hold that line: the buffer does not accumulate across undrained
ticks, and a long-lived world's snapshot is not proportional to its history.

### What the ecology now reports

`step` took counts and gave back counts, so a history had nothing but
aggregates to record. It now reports individuals as well: births, maturings,
feedings, deaths, and returns, alongside the `Tally` a host shows. Significance
needs to know *who*, and a count cannot say.

The founding population is recorded too. Without it a seeded creature's first
event is whatever happened *to* it, so its origin is invisible and its causal
line begins in the middle. That was found by a test asserting the first meal
had antecedents; it did not, and the assertion was right.

### On real data

`tests/past.rs` runs an enclosure and checks the shape rather than the plumbing.
The one worth naming: **most pairs of events in a live ecology are concurrent**,
by a majority, because creatures act independently. A flat log would have had to
invent an order between them and then imply it meant something.

### What it unblocks and what it does not

Significance's traversal half now has something to traverse:
`consequences(seq)` answers what followed from an event, which is the
retroactive definition. What it does not do is *score*, because that needs
places for `Scale` to mean anything and speciation for a lineage to be forkable.
`WorldRecord::note` still has no callers.
---

## 11. Speciation, and the frontier that finally binds

**Built 2026-08-02.** Two things landed together because they are the same
subject: what a lineage *is*, and who may be one.

### Splitting is an act

`Intent::Speciate { name }` forks the line the player is holding. The ruling
was that splitting happens because something *happened*, not because a metric
crossed a line, and for the player that act is naming. So the name is not
metadata on the event, it *is* the event.

**A founder crosses alone.** Forking takes the creature you are holding and
nothing else; its offspring inherit the new line and its former kin keep the
old one. That makes it a commitment rather than a free rename, and it is how a
founder effect actually works.

`mesocosm-core::species` holds the registry: what exists, what it is called,
what it came from, when. A world's opening lineages are **unnamed**, because
nobody was there to name them, which makes naming the same promotion one level
up from a critter becoming a borg.

Nothing is ever removed. Pruning an extinct lineage would erase the ancestry of
everything descended from it, and a distance measured against a forgotten
ancestor is not a distance.

### Kinship is computable now

`Lineages::distance` is the longer walk to a common ancestor, so a parent and
child are one apart and two siblings are also one. Two founding lineages return
**`None`** rather than a large number, which is the honest answer: they are not
related, and inventing a shared ancestor to make the arithmetic work would be a
lie the graft rule then acts on.

That closes one of the three axes Mark named for graft compatibility. It was
uncomputable before, because lineages never split and every pair was either
identical or unrelated.

### The frontier binds where control moves

The complexity-frontier rule was ruled long ago and lived in
`epoch::can_switch_to`, which nothing outside its own tests ever called. Control
could take anything alive, however elaborate. It now binds in
`World::eligibility`, on **anatomy-derived complexity** rather than the
provisional trait array, which P1 made possible by giving every organism a body.

Two corrections found by tests rather than review, and the first is the
important one:

- **The frontier is a high-water mark.** My first cut read it from living
  organisms of unlocked species, so a lineage dying out collapsed it to zero and
  left the world **permanently uninhabitable**. That contradicts the ruling that
  disembodiment is a seam rather than a dead end: losing a body must not unearn
  what reaching it cost. Same max-register shape as the world record, which is
  now the fourth place that pattern has turned up.
- **It seeds from the starting body**, because the player is already holding
  something. At zero, a fresh world could not switch to anything at all.

A line you have lived is always yours to return to. The frontier gates reaching
*outward*, not going home, or growing a body would lock you out of the line you
grew it in.

### What this cost

`Intent` is no longer `Copy`, because a name is a `String`. Twelve call sites
clone instead. Worth it: the alternative was naming as a second act, which
would have made the name metadata rather than the deed.

### Still not built

**NPC speciation.** An unplayed lineage splits on a significant event, and
significance still needs scoring, which needs places. The player half stands
alone because naming needs nothing but a player.
---

## 12. Places, and the reckoning all four pieces were for

**Built 2026-08-02.** The last of the four, and then the thing they were each
missing a piece of.

### An enclosure gets somewhere in it

`Scale` had three variants and no way to tell them apart. `CROWD_CELL` looked
like the missing piece and is not: an eight-voxel bucket for counting
neighbours, recomputed every tick, with no identity to remember and nothing
next to anything.

`mesocosm-core::places` is two facts that are not the same fact.

**A partition**, because everything in the enclosure is already at a position
and has to be *in* somewhere: sites scattered one per cell of a coarse grid and
jittered inside it, with a position belonging to the nearest. Stratifying rather
than scattering freely keeps regions from collapsing into slivers; the jitter
keeps the result from looking like the grid it came from.

**A graph**, because three regions in a row and three scattered across the
enclosure are the same count and a different fact. `spread` is the hop diameter
of a touched set, which is the plan's *locality* axis: how confined it was, as
distinct from how much it covered. Adjacency is the grid's, so no seed can
produce an enclosure with an unreachable corner.

Height is not a place. The enclosure is a few voxels deep and nothing lives in a
layer, which is the same reading of position `organism::ecology` already takes.

Places draw from **their own stream**, salted off the world seed. Drawing from
the world's would shift every draw after it, so dividing an enclosure would
silently rearrange the creatures scattered across it.

### Scale is read, never declared

One region is Local; a strict majority of the enclosure is Worldwide; between
them is Regional. A majority is the least arbitrary reading of "most of the
world" available, and the alternative was picking a fraction.

**A lineage's range is a high-water set**, the same shape as the frontier one
scale down, and the fifth place that pattern has turned up. Where a creature has
been is not readable from where it is, and a lineage that withdrew from half the
enclosure still reached it. Union is commutative, associative, and idempotent,
so two worlds' ranges join the way their records do, without a protocol.

### The reckoning

`WorldRecord::note` was built on 2026-08-01 because its *shape* was the question,
and it had no callers through three sessions. `mesocosm-core::score` is the
caller, and it is last rather than first because a reckoning needs all four at
once: the log to read what happened, the species tree to have lineages worth
telling apart, places for `Scale` to mean anything, and the record to write into.

`World::end_epoch` takes the past, because history lives beside a world rather
than inside it: a world can say what is, never what happened. It returns every
reading with whether it took the record, which is what an epoch-boundary screen
is made of: not the numbers, but which of them nobody had reached before.

Nothing here is a counter the simulation maintains. Every figure is read off the
world and its past when the epoch ends, which is the same discipline capability,
temperament, and the possibility space already run on.

**Predation is the log paying for itself.** Taking from the living and taking
from the dead are the same `Fed` event, and the difference between a predator
and a scavenger is *only* answerable because the log preserves order: a meal
counts as predation when no `Died` about that creature came before it. Nothing
else could have recovered that afterwards.

**Two axes stay empty on purpose.** Nothing yet gives to another creature or
changes the enclosure, so `Symbiosis` and `Construction` are never noted. That is
worth more than a zero: `untouched` answers *has anyone ever*, and writing
zeroes would close the question permanently on every world's first epoch.

### The runtime finally records

The world buffers one tick of events and a caller drains them, and **nothing in
the shipped app was that caller.** Every driven run had a present and no past,
while only the tests had a history. `Runtime` now records beside the trace it
already keeps.

That made `Runtime::replay` wrong in a way worth keeping: a driven run drains
every tick and a replay that did not ended holding a tick of undrained events,
which is a difference in the snapshot and so in the state hash. `replay` returns
the past as well as the world now, which turns the claim that history is
derivable, which is the reason it stays out of the snapshot, into something
executable.

### Still not built

- **Events carry no place.** A feat is scaled by how far the lineage that
  performed it reaches, not by where each act happened, because the events say
  who and how much and not where. That is the next thing places want.
- **Events carry no tick**, so `Endurance` is read from the living. A creature
  that lived long and died between two reckonings is not counted.
- **Nothing names a place.** Naming arrives with the reward that grants it, the
  same promotion that makes a critter a borg and a lineage a species, so `Place`
  deliberately has no name field yet.
- **NPC speciation**, which was waiting on scoring, is now only waiting on the
  rule for what counts as significant enough to split a line.
---

## 7. Stop rules

- Do not speciate on a similarity threshold. Splitting is an act with a record
  of why.
- Do not edit a lineage revision in place or merge concurrent developmental
  proposals cell by cell. Agreement adopts one child; disagreement preserves
  descent.
- Do not author a significance table. Significance is measured against the
  world's own record or it is not significance.
- Do not collapse retroactive abnormality and selected goals into one system.
- Do not let the storyteller pick outcomes. It picks the insult; the world
  decides the consequence.
- Do not offer a goal that has not been verified achievable and novel.
- Do not make plasticity free. Youth buys change with capability.
- Do not store a temperament. It is a fold over substrate and history.
- Do not grow the event log without a selector; that is the tulpa mechanic and
  it is load-bearing rather than decorative.
- Do not make the world record answer traversal questions. Abnormality is a
  lookup; what-depended-on-this is the causal log.
- Do not note a zero. `untouched` answers "has anyone ever", and a zero mark
  answers it yes forever.
- Do not compute a range from where a lineage is. It is a high-water set, for
  the same reason the frontier is a high-water mark.
- Do not break the semilattice. Any change to `Mark::join` must keep merging
  commutative, associative, and idempotent, or worlds stop combining without a
  protocol.

---

## 8. Open questions

1. ~~**What is the smallest world record that supports abnormality?**~~
   **Answered and built 2026-08-01**: per-axis high-water marks, in
   `mesocosm-core::record`. See §9.
2. **Does an unplayed lineage's speciation get a name?** If naming is the act,
   something must name NPC forks, and a procedural name is a different kind of
   fact from a player's.
3. **Can a goal be failed, or only unmet?** Failure implies stakes and a
   record; unmet implies it simply expires.
4. **Does plasticity apply to anatomy, temperament, or both?** The life-stage
   ruling was made about temperament, but the same trade would work for
   developmental change, and P4's adaptation bridge is where that decides.
5. **How does ancestral distance survive a world boundary?** A chronicle
   carries part provenance by species id; two worlds' species ids mean nothing
   to each other, so cross-world distance needs the wing contract's subject
   identity rather than a local id.
6. **Who must adopt a shared continuation?** The same-session case is clear,
   but persistent and asynchronous play still needs a standing rule. Requiring
   every historical inhabitant would freeze old lineages; treating silence as
   consent would rewrite somebody else's continuation.

---

## Findings

- **2026-08-02:** nothing in the shipped app drained the world's event buffer,
  so every driven run had a present and no past. History existed only in tests.
- **2026-08-02:** `Runtime::replay` diverged from the run it replayed once the
  driver started draining, because undrained events are part of the snapshot and
  therefore part of the state hash. Reproducing the history is the fix, and it
  is also the derivability claim made executable.

- **2026-08-02:** the complexity frontier had never been enforced anywhere
  control moved. It lived in `epoch::can_switch_to`, called by nothing outside
  its own tests, so any living creature could be inhabited however elaborate.
  It could not simply be wired up either, because that function reasons over
  `epoch::Lineage`'s trait array while control reasons over organisms; P1's
  body-on-every-organism is what made an anatomy-derived complexity available
  to both.
- **2026-08-02:** computing the frontier from *living* organisms made a
  lineage's extinction permanently end the game. A high-water mark is the only
  reading compatible with disembodiment being a seam.

- **2026-08-02:** `#[serde(skip_serializing_if)]` is a trap with postcard,
  which is positional: a field written conditionally cannot be read back. It
  broke a world snapshot here, and the same mistake had already shipped into
  codicil the day before, where muniment's pluggable codec would have hit it
  for any consumer persisting a causeless log. This stack has now paid for that
  lesson three times, counting the body profile's out-of-payload version
  header.
- **2026-08-02:** the ecology reported only counts, so the first meal in a
  recorded history had no antecedents: the founding population had no births.
  Seeded organisms are now recorded as born, because a creature whose origin is
  absent has a causal line that begins in the middle.

- **2026-08-01:** sibylla is **not** a substitute for a text index, and an
  earlier claim here that it was is wrong. It is a semantic retrieval seam:
  embeddings into fixed-dimension vectors with a flat `O(N)` index, answering
  "what is like this" rather than "what contains this". It does ship a
  model-free lexical embedder using the hashing trick and a wasm-clean default
  build, which makes it a plausible *journal search* later. Neither modality
  answers "has anyone ever done this", which is what the record needed.
- **2026-08-01:** the requirement that selected the record's shape was
  **mergeability**, not size. Both heavier options fail on it: text indices lose
  comparable relevance across a merge, and vector indices require both worlds to
  have used the same embedding model.

- **2026-08-01:** speciation does not exist; `species: parent.species` and no
  other assignment outside seeding. Lineages cannot split, so ancestral
  distance is zero for every pair and no new species is ever born.
- **2026-08-01:** there is no accumulating event log. `World::apply_all`
  returns `Vec<Outcome>` and drops it; `mesocosm-runtime` keeps one tick's
  worth in `last`. Every proposal in this plan that reads history needs one.
- **2026-08-01:** worlds have no places. `CROWD_CELL` is a density grid, so
  locality and magnitude have nothing to be measured against yet.
- **2026-08-01:** shared-lineage adaptation is the first concrete domain where
  multi-writer disagreement should preserve two descendants rather than merge
  fields. It needs immutable lineage revisions and explicit adoption, not a
  general conflict-free document.
- **2026-08-03:** the shared object being adopted is the developmental program.
  The arranged body is a reproducible founder preview, not a promise that every
  descendant will express one literal phenotype.

## Progress

- **2026-08-31:** separated reproduction's individual checkpoint from this
  lineage checkpoint and linked the playable ecology integration plan. No
  implementation or earlier boundary ruling changed.

- **2026-08-01:** speciation-by-act, significance-as-abnormality, the scoring
  axes, the reward ladder, goal selection, and life-stage plasticity recorded
  from dialogue. No implementation added.
- **2026-08-01:** recorded shared-lineage authorship: every adaptation produces
  an immutable child revision; agreement shares a continuation and disagreement
  branches without forcing every revision to become a species.
- **2026-08-03:** resolved the co-signing target: co-players adopt one
  developmental program, while world-conditioned phenotype realization remains
  free to vary.
